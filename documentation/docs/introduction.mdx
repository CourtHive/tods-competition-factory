The **Competition Factory** represents a fundamental shift in how tournament management systems are architected. By separating tournament operations from infrastructure concerns, it enables unprecedented flexibility in deployment architectures while ensuring data integrity and long-term accessibility.

### Configurable Tournament Operations

The **Competition Factory** is a collection of functions for transforming and mutating tournament records. Core engines capture the types of state transitions fundamental to running tournaments - draw generation, participant assignments, matchUp scheduling, score recording, and outcome determination.

Rather than hardcoding tournament structures or embedding business rules in database stored procedures, the factory is configured through **JSON policy definitions** and **JSON-described tournament structures**. This architectural approach provides:

- **Deployment Flexibility**: Operations can execute on standalone clients, servers, or both
- **Platform Independence**: An entire tournament management solution [can run in a browser](https://courthive.github.io/TMX), communicate with a server, or operate entirely offline
- **Scalable Architectures**: Server deployments support highly scalable asynchronous processing models in **Node.js**
- **Configurable Behavior**: Reasonable defaults for all operations, with extensive configuration options through policy definitions
- **Consistent Results**: The same configuration produces identical tournament structures regardless of where operations execute

### Cross-Sport Applicability

While the **Competition Factory** was originally inspired by the **[Tennis Open Data Standards (TODS)](https://itftennis.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/TODS/overview)**, the data structures and configurable operations apply to tournaments across many sports. The factory has already been successfully deployed across **five racquet sports**, demonstrating the universality of its approach. This cross-sport reality is now reflected in **[CODES](/docs/data-standards#codes)** (Competition Open Data Exchange Standards), the factory's expanded data model.

### State Management and Extensibility

The **Competition Factory** includes synchronous and asynchronous **state engines** that provide services for:

- Managing tournament record state throughout event lifecycles
- Publishing subscriptions for real-time data synchronization
- Notifications and logging for audit trails
- Middleware integration for custom business logic

This architecture enables both real-time tournament management during active events and comprehensive historical analysis of completed competitions.

### Liberation from Legacy Constraints

Traditional tournament management systems have created significant operational and financial burdens:

- **Vendor Lock-In**: Dependence on active maintenance contracts to access historical data
- **Database Complexity**: Reliance on specific database platforms, versions, and licensing
- **Schema Evolution**: Business logic tightly coupled to database schemas that evolve over time
- **Deployment Overhead**: Complex infrastructure requirements including third-party database licenses
- **Data Migration**: Painful transitions when systems are upgraded or replaced

The **Competition Factory** eliminates these constraints through document-based data standards and configurable tournament operations, providing organizations with complete control over their tournament data and operational infrastructure.
