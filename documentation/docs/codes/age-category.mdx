title: Age Category Codes
---

Age category codes may appear on an attribute of a [`category`](../types/typedefs/#generic), which can appear in `event` and `drawDefinition` elements within a tournament record.

See [ITF Standard Codes](https://itftennis.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/TODS/pages/1272840305/Standard+Codes) for an explanation of the construction of age category codes.

A `consideredDate` is required for calculating `ageMaxDate` and `ageMinDate`, values which can be used to validate a `participant` entry into an event.

```js
import { queryEngine } from 'tods-competition-factory';

const { ageMax, ageMin, ageMaxDate, ageMinDate } = queryEngine.getCategoryAgeDetails({
  category: { ageCategoryCode },
  consideredDate, // required - typically the startDate or endDate of a tournament
});
```
