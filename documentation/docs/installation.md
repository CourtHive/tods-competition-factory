## Test

The **Competition Factory** is built following a Test Driven Development process. There are more than 200 test suites and more than 600 individual tests that run before every release.

These tests are good references for how to use the APIs provided by the `drawEngine`, `tournamentEngine`, `competitionEngine` and `mocksEngine`.

```sh
yarn test
```
