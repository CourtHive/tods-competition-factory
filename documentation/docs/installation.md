## Test

The **Competition Factory** is built following a Test Driven Development process. There are ~300 test suites and ~950 individual tests that run before every release, covering greater than 92% of the code base.

These tests are good references for how to use the APIs provided by the `drawEngine`, `tournamentEngine`, `competitionEngine`, `mocksEngine` and `scoreGovernor`.

```sh
yarn test
```
