## Mock Tournament Generation

The `mocksEngine` can generate entire TODS tournament documents, including participants, events, and draws.

```jsx live
function MocksEngineDemo(props) {
  const { tournamentRecord } = mocksEngine.generateTournamentRecord();

  return <Tournament data={tournamentRecord} />;
}
```

See [Generating Tournaments](engines/mocks-engine-examples) for more examples of mock tournament generation,

:::note Live Visualizations
For a live example of the `mocksEngine` in action, see the **[Example: tods-react-draws](https://courthive.github.io/tods-react-draws/example)**

## Draw Generation

Draws are the centerpiece of any tournament. While TODS strives to be agnostic about the specific type of draw represented by a `drawDefinition`, **Competition Factory** includes a convenience method which exercises other methods to generate a wide range of recognized [draw types](engines/draw-types).

```jsx live
function DrawDefinitionDemo(props) {
  const { drawDefinition } = tournamentEngine.generateDrawDefinition({
    drawSize: 32,
    drawName: 'Demo Draw',
    drawType: 'COMPASS',
  });

  return <Draw data={drawDefinition} />;
}
```

### Generating Multiple Flights

`generateFlightProfile()` generates flighted draw details which can be fed into `generateDrawDefinition()`.

## Scheduling

In addition to individual and bulk manual scheduling methods, the **Competition Factory** supports automated **Garman Scheduling** and surfaces the Garman calculations at various levels of abstraction, all of which are dependent on a tournament record including `venues` with `courts` with defined `dateAvailability`, as well as an expected `averageMatchUpMinutes`. Scheduling methods are surfaced via the `competitionEngine` to enable scheduling multiple tournaments with shared `venues`.

### calculateScheduleTimes()

At the lowest level there is `calculateScheduleTimes()` which returns an array of available schedule times for a given date (and optional time range).

### scheduleMatchUps()

`scheduleMatchUps()` takes an ordered array of `matchUpIds` and target `venueIds` and assigns a `scheduledTime` to each `matchUp`.

### scheduleProfileRounds()

The ordering of `matchUps` is handled automatically by `scheduleProfileRounds()` which uses a `schedulingProfile` to not only automatically determine the order of `matchUps` from specified `rounds`, but also considers per-player (and per-format) daily matchUp limmits and scheduling policies which are attached to the tournament record(s). Scheduling policies can define both **average minutes** and **recovery mintes** for each `matchUpFormat`, and policy defaults can be overridden by event-level settings. For a full explanation see [Advanced Scheduling Pseudocode](pseudocode/scheduling).
