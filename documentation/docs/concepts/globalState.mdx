title: Global State

## Engines share state

Except in cases where `tournamentEngine` is used to generate a `tournamentRecord` from scratch,
it is necessary to first call a `.setState()` engine method.

Setting `tournamentEngine` state adds a tournamentRecord to global state, which makes it available to `competitionEngine`.

```js
tournamentEngine.setState(tournamentRecord);
const { tournamentRecords } = competitionEngine.getState();
```

If multiple tournamentRecords are added to `competitionEngine` state,
`tournamentEngine` can point to a specific tournamentRecord by setting `tournamentId`.

```js
competitionEngine.setState(tournamentRecords);
tournamentEngine.setTournamentId(tournamentId);
const { tournamentRecord } = tournamentEngine.getState();
```

When a single tournamentRecord is added via `competitionEngine`, `tournamentId` is set automatically.

## Synchronous and Asynchronous

Competition Factory engines share a global state which is by default **synchronous**.

In the `/sr/global/examples` there is an example of an **asynchronous** global state provider which can be copied into projects,
typically nodejs servers, which require asynchronous processing.

```js
import asyncGlobalState from '../src/global/examples/asyncGlobalState';

setStateProvider(asyncGlobalState);
const asyncTournamentEngine = tournamentEngineAsync();
const asyncCompetitionEngine = competitionEngineAsync();
```

:::note
There is no need to define a "stateProvider" for synchronous use, but it is possible to provide an alternate implementation.
