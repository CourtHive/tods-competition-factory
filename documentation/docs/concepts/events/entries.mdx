## Overview

Participants must be entered into an event before being placed in draws. Event entries track which participants are accepted, waitlisted, or withdrawn from an event.

## Adding Entries

```js
// Add multiple participants to event
tournamentEngine.addEventEntries({
  eventId,
  participantIds: ['player1-id', 'player2-id', 'player3-id'],
  entryStage: 'MAIN', // MAIN, QUALIFYING, DIRECT_ACCEPTANCE
  entryStatus: 'DIRECT_ACCEPTANCE', // Status in entry priority
});
```

## Entry Status Values

- **DIRECT_ACCEPTANCE** - Automatically accepted into the event
- **UNGROUPED** - Entered but not yet assigned to a draw
- **ALTERNATE** - On waitlist, may be moved to direct acceptance
- **WITHDRAWN** - Withdrawn from the event

## Drawing from Entries

When generating a draw, you can specify which entries to include. If you don't provide `drawEntries`, the factory uses reasonable defaults.

### Default Behavior

- When an event has **only one draw**, all event entries are automatically included
- For **multiple draws**, you must specify which entries go into each draw

### Manual Entry Selection

```js
const { drawDefinition } = tournamentEngine.generateDrawDefinition({
  eventId,
  drawSize: 32,
  drawEntries: event.entries.filter((e) => e.entryStatus === 'DIRECT_ACCEPTANCE'),
  automated: true,
});
```

## Participant Assignment Best Practice

Since categories pertain to events, typically a participant appears only once in an event. While it's technically possible to generate multiple draws using the same event entries, **best practice is to have participants participate in only one draw per category/event**.

If you need to separate participants by skill level, use [flight profiles](./flights) rather than duplicating entries across multiple draws.

## Modifying Entries

### Update Entry Status

```js
tournamentEngine.modifyEventEntries({
  eventId,
  participantIds: ['player-id'],
  entryStatus: 'WITHDRAWN',
});
```

### Delete Entries

```js
tournamentEngine.deleteEventEntries({
  eventId,
  participantIds: ['player-id'],
});
```

## Entry Stages

Entries can be designated for different stages of competition:

- **MAIN** - Main draw entries
- **QUALIFYING** - Qualifying round entries
- **DIRECT_ACCEPTANCE** - Directly accepted participants

```js
// Add participants to qualifying stage
tournamentEngine.addEventEntries({
  eventId,
  participantIds: qualifyingPlayerIds,
  entryStage: 'QUALIFYING',
  entryStatus: 'DIRECT_ACCEPTANCE',
});
```

## Complete Example

```js
import { tournamentEngine } from 'tods-competition-factory';

// 1. Create event
const event = {
  eventName: 'Girls U16 Singles',
  eventType: 'SINGLES',
  category: {
    categoryName: 'Girls Under 16',
    ageCategoryCode: '16U',
  },
};

const {
  event: { eventId },
} = tournamentEngine.addEvent({ event });

// 2. Add accepted participants
tournamentEngine.addEventEntries({
  eventId,
  participantIds: acceptedPlayerIds,
  entryStatus: 'DIRECT_ACCEPTANCE',
  entryStage: 'MAIN',
});

// 3. Add alternates
tournamentEngine.addEventEntries({
  eventId,
  participantIds: alternatePlayerIds,
  entryStatus: 'ALTERNATE',
  entryStage: 'MAIN',
});

// 4. Generate draw (uses DIRECT_ACCEPTANCE entries by default)
const { drawDefinition } = tournamentEngine.generateDrawDefinition({
  eventId,
  drawSize: 32,
  automated: true,
});

tournamentEngine.addDrawDefinition({ eventId, drawDefinition });
```
