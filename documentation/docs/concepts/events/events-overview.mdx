## What are Events?

Events are the organizational structure within a tournament that group participants competing in the same discipline and category. Each event can contain multiple **drawDefinitions** (also called "flights") that segment participants into separate competitions while maintaining a shared category definition.

### Hierarchical Structure

```
Tournament
  └── Event (e.g., "Boys U18 Singles")
      ├── Category (age, rating, ball type)
      ├── Entries (participants accepted into the event)
      └── DrawDefinitions (flights/draws)
          ├── Main Draw
          ├── Qualifying Draw
          ├── Consolation Draw
          └── Additional Flights (A Flight, B Flight, etc.)
```

## Creating Events

```js
import { tournamentEngine } from 'tods-competition-factory';

const event = {
  eventName: 'Boys U18 Singles',
  eventType: 'SINGLES', // SINGLES, DOUBLES, TEAM
  category: {
    categoryName: 'Boys Under 18',
    ageCategoryCode: '18U',
  },
};

const { event: createdEvent } = tournamentEngine.addEvent({ event });
const eventId = createdEvent.eventId;
```
