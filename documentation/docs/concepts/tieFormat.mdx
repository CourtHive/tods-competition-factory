## Overview

A `tieFormat` both describes collections of singles and doubles `tieMatchUps` which are part of a **_Dual_** or **_Team_** match,
and defines the target value which must be achieved in order to win the `matchUp`.

There can be any number of `collectionDefinitions` in a `tieMatchUp`.
For instance, there can be "Men's Singles", "Men's Doubles", "Womens's Singles", "Women's Doubles", and "Mixed Doubles".

Each `collectionDefinition` defines how many `matchUps` are in the collection, the `matchUpType` (SINGLES or DOUBLES), the `matchUpFormat` to be used for scoring, and what value should be assigned to `matchUps` or entire collections.
The value may be the same for each `matchUp`; `matchUps` may have a value tied to their `collectionPosition`;
or a value may be awarded to the winner of the collection.

## tieFormat Use

### Generating Draws

The generation of `drawDefinitions` requires a `tieFormat` to determine how many `tieMatchUps` for each collection are contained in the `matchUp` between two teams.
When `tieMatchUps` are generated they are assigned a `collectionId` and a `collectionPosition`.
If there are six `tieMatchUps` in a collection, they will be assigned `collectionPositions` **1-6**.

### Determining Winners

As results of singles and/or doubles `matchUps` are recorded, the `tieFormat` is used to calculate the score for each side and determine when a side has achieved the score neessary to win.

### Mapping lineUps

A `tieFormat` determines the relationship between a team's `lineUp` and the `tieMatchUps` within a `matchUp` by defining the mapping between `collectionIds`, `collectionPositions` and participant `collectionAssignments`.

## tieFormat Example

- each **SINGLES match** has a value of **1**
- the entire **DOUBLES Collection** has a value of **1**
- the `valueGoal` is **4**

```js
const tieFormat = {
  winCriteria: {
    valueGoal: 4, // the value that must be achieved to win the match
  },
  collectionDefinitions: [
    {
      collectionId: 'singlesCollectionId',
      collectionGroupNumber: 1, // optional, if there are groups
      collectionName: 'Singles',
      matchUpType: SINGLES,
      matchUpCount: 6,
      matchUpFormat: 'SET3-S:6/TB7',
      matchUpValue: 1,
    },
    {
      collectionId: 'doublesCollectionId',
      collectionGroupNumber: 1, // optional, if there are groups
      collectionName: 'Doubles',
      matchUpType: DOUBLES,
      matchUpCount: 3,
      matchUpFormat: 'SET3-S:6/TB7-F:TB10',
      collectionValue: 1,
    },
  ],
  // optional group details
  collectionGroups: [
    {
      groupNumber: 1,
      groupName: 'Day 1', // used to group collections, e.g. Laver Cup
    },
  ],
};
```
