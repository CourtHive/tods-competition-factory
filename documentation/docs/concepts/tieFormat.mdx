## Overview

A `tieFormat` both describes collections of singles and doubles `tieMatchUps` which are part of a `{ matchUpType: TEAM }` `matchUp`, and defines the target value which must be achieved in order to win the `matchUp`.

There can be any number of `collectionDefinitions` in a `tieMatchUp`.
For instance, there can be "Men's Singles", "Men's Doubles", "Womens's Singles", "Women's Doubles", and "Mixed Doubles".

Each `collectionDefinition` defines how many `matchUps` are in the collection, the `matchUpType` (SINGLES or DOUBLES), the `matchUpFormat` to be used for scoring, and how value is assigned to each `matchUp`.
`collectionDefinitions` can optionally define `category` and `gender`.

## Value Considerations

The score of a TEAM `matchUp` is the summation of the value assigned for the wins on each side. Value can be assigned in numerous ways.
When there is no `winCriteria` specified, the `valueGoal` defaults to one more than half of the potential value within scope (which can be the `tieFormat`, a `collectionDefinition`, or a `collectionGroup`).

- **matchUpValue** - specified value is awarded for each `matchUp` win
- **setValue** - specified value is awarded for each set win
- **collectionValue** - specified value is awarded for winning a collection
- **collecitonValueProfile** - unique values are specified for each `collectionPosition` within a collection
- **groupValue** - specified value is awarded for reaching a `valueGoal` by accumulating value across collections in the group
- **scoreValue** - specified value is awarded for each sideScore (typically 1, typically used with `aggregateValue` formats)

See [tieFormat type definitions](../types/typedefs#tieformat)

## tieFormat Use

### Generating Draws

The generation of `drawDefinitions` requires a `tieFormat` to determine how many `tieMatchUps` for each collection are contained in the `matchUp` between two teams.
When `tieMatchUps` are generated they are assigned a `collectionId` and a `collectionPosition`.
If there are six `tieMatchUps` in a collection, they will be assigned `collectionPositions` **1-6**.

### Mapping lineUps

A `tieFormat` determines the relationship between a team's `lineUp` and the `tieMatchUps` within a `matchUp` by defining the mapping between `collectionIds`, `collectionPositions` and participant `collectionAssignments`.

## tieFormat Example

- each **SINGLES matchUp** has a value of **1**
- the entire **DOUBLES Collection** has a value of **1**
- the `valueGoal` is **4**

```js
const tieFormat = {
  winCriteria: {
    valueGoal: 4, // the value that must be achieved to win the match
  },
  collectionDefinitions: [
    {
      collectionId: 'singlesCollectionId',
      collectionGroupNumber: 1, // optional, if there are groups
      collectionName: 'Singles',
      matchUpFormat: 'SET3-S:6/TB7',
      matchUpType: SINGLES,
      matchUpCount: 6,
      matchUpValue: 1, // value awarded for each matchUp win
    },
    {
      collectionId: 'doublesCollectionId',
      collectionGroupNumber: 1, // optional, if there are groups
      collectionName: 'Doubles',
      collectionValue: 1, // value awarded for winning one more than half of the matchUps in the collection
      matchUpFormat: 'SET3-S:6/TB7-F:TB10',
      matchUpType: DOUBLES,
      matchUpCount: 3,
    },
  ],
  // optional group details
  collectionGroups: [
    {
      groupName: 'Day 1', // used to group collections, e.g. Laver Cup
      groupNumber: 1,
    },
  ],
};
```

## tieFormat and lineUp propagation

`tieFormats` can be attached to a tournament record at multiple levels wthin the hierarchy `event` > `drawDefinition` > `structure` > `matchUp`.
This means that when a `tieFormat` is not present on a `matchUp` the definition is resolved by walking the hierarchy.
When a `matchUp` is scored, the appropriate `tieFormat` is attached to the `matchUp`.
This is necessary because at any point in a `structure` or `drawDefinition` the scoped `tieFormat` may be edite/changed;
for instance, if there is a rain delay, the format may be shortened for `matchUps` which have not yet been played.
The mapping between `participants` in a `lineUp` must be preserved for `matchUps` which are IN_PROGRESS or COMPLETED.

As TEAM `participants` progress through draw `structures` the most recent `lineUp` is saved (via an `extension` on the `drawDefinition`) such that it can be propagated to subsequent `matchUps`.
When a `matchUp` is scored or the `lineUp` changes, the `lineUp` is saved directly to the target `matchUp`.
