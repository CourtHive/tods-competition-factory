title: Introduction to Policies
---

Policies determine how the various Competition Factory engines function and can shape the way that results are returned. Policies can be attached to the `tournamentRecord`, `events`, or to `drawDefinitions` within an `event`. They can also be passed directly into some factory methods; e.g. a **Participant Policy** can be passed into a method which returns particpipants and filter out attributes which are not to be displayed.

The structure of a **_policyDefinitions_** object is as follows:

```json
{
  [policyType]: {      // e.g. 'seeding' or 'avoidance'
    policyName: 'name'  // for 'seeding' can be the provider of the policy, e.g. 'ITF' or 'USTA'
    ...attributes       // attributes relevant to the policyType
  },
  [anotherPolicyType]: {
    policyName: 'name'
    ...attributes
  },
}
```

## Policy Types

- [Avoidance Policy](../policies/avoidance): Can be attached to drawDefinitions to specify the attriubutes by which participants should be separated
- [Participant Policy](../policies/participantPolicy.md) Enables participant details to be filtered to respect privacy concerns
- [Position Actions Policy](../policies/positionActions): Determines valid actions for positions in a draw structure
- [MatchUp Actions Policy](../policies/matchUpActions): Determines valid actions for matchUps (substitutions, penalties, referree, scheduling)
- [Seeding Policy](../policies/seedingPolicy): Sets seeding pattern and thresholds for number of seeds allowed for draw sizes
- [Scheduling Policy](../policies/scheduling): Defines average and rest/recovery times for matchUpFormats, categoryNames, and categoryTypes
- [Round Robin Tally Policy](../policies/tallyPolicy): Configures calculations which determine participant finishing positions
- [Feed-In Policy](../policies/feedInPolicy): Determining the the patterns which direct participants into consolation feed rounds
- [Progression Policy](../policies/progressionPolicy): Configuration related to participant progression, e.g. automatic qualifier placement, double-exit effects
- [Round Naming Policy](../policies/roundNaming): Specifies how rounds of draw structures should be named
- [Scoring Policy](../policies/scoringPolicy): Restricts available matchUpFormats, defines a default and conditions for "ready to score"
- [Voluntary Consolation Policy](../policies/consolationPolicy.md): Specifies `{ winsLimit, finishingRoundLimit }` for voluntary consolation eligibility
- [Competitive Bands](../policies/competitiveBands): Determines thresholds for ROUTINE and COMPETITIVE matches in `getCompetitiveProfile`
- [Draws Policy](/docs/policies/draws): Configures either global or draw-type-specific `drawTypeCoercion`
