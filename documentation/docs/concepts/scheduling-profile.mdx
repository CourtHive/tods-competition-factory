## schedulingProfile

To support the use of the Garman formula for scheduling `matchUps` from different events,
factory `engine` makes use of a `schedulingProfile` to define the order of `rounds` of structures within `drawDefinitions`
to be scheduled on specific days, and then iteratively calls the Garman formula.

The `schedulingProfile` is an array of profiles for the `scheduleDates` to be scheduled; it is stored as an `extension` attached to the tournament record.
The factory provides convenience methods for creating and manipulting the `schedulingProfile`, or it can be generated externally and attached
via `setSchedulingProfile()`.

Each `scheduleDate` profile object must include the attributes `{ scheduleDate, venues }`, and the `venues` attribute must be an array of venue profile objects
which include the attributes `{ venueId, rounds }`, where `rounds` is an array of objects with the following attributes:

```js
[
  {
    // required
    tournamentId,
    eventId,
    drawId,
    structureId,
    roundNumber,

    //optional
    notBeforeTime, // optional - 'HH:MM' timeString - TO BE IMPLEMENTED
    roundSegment: {
      segmentNumber, // segment which is to be scheduled
      segmentsCount, // number of segments in a round
    },
  },
];
```

### Example

In this example additional attributes have been added by the client applications for display purposes.
They are not required for automated scheduling to function.

<RenderJSON data={SchedulingProfile} root={'schedulingProfile'} colorScheme={'summerfruit'} invertTheme={true} />
