## Overview

A `lineUp` is provided by each side of a **_Dual_** or **_Team_** match;
it is a mapping of team `participantIds` to their `collectionAssignments` which specify the `matchUps` in which they will compete.

## lineUp Example

In this example, each team member, identified by their `participantId`, is assigned to both a singles and a doubles `tieMatchUp`.
They are assigned to **different** `collectionPositions` in the singles collection, but the **same** `collectionPosition` in the doubles collection,
which means they also appear in the `tournamentRecord` as a PAIR.

```js
[
  {
    participantId: 'pId1',
    collectionAssignments: [
      {
        collectionId: 'singlesCollectionId',
        collectionPosition: 1,
      },
      {
        collectionId: 'doublesCollectionId',
        collectionPosition: 1,
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    participantId: 'pId2',
    collectionAssignments: [
      {
        collectionId: 'singlesCollectionId',
        collectionPosition: 2,
      },
      {
        collectionId: 'doublesCollectionId',
        collectionPosition: 1,
      },
    ],
  },
];
```
