## Overview

Scheduling is the process of assigning **dates**, **venues**, **courts**, and **times** to tournament matchUps. The Competition Factory provides a comprehensive scheduling system that supports both manual and automated scheduling workflows, from simple club tournaments to complex multi-tournament professional events.

## Core Concepts

### TimeItems Architecture

In TODS (Tennis Open Data Standards), scheduling information is attached to matchUps as `timeItems` rather than stored in a centralized schedule object. This decentralized approach provides several advantages:

- **No orphaned schedules**: When draws or structures are deleted, their scheduling information is automatically removed
- **Granular control**: Each matchUp independently tracks its scheduling history
- **Audit trail**: TimeItems preserve the complete scheduling history including modifications
- **Flexible querying**: Schedules are derived on-demand by interrogating matchUp timeItems

### Scheduling Methods

The Competition Factory supports multiple scheduling approaches:

1. **Manual Scheduling**: Direct assignment of scheduling attributes
   - `addMatchUpScheduledDate()` - Assign a date
   - `addMatchUpScheduledTime()` - Assign a time
   - `assignMatchUpVenue()` - Assign a venue
   - `assignMatchUpCourt()` - Assign a specific court

2. **Automated Scheduling**: Algorithm-driven scheduling
   - `scheduleMatchUps()` - Schedule matchUps for a single day/venue
   - `scheduleProfileRounds()` - Schedule across multiple days using a scheduling profile
   - Supports Garman formula for optimal court utilization

3. **Hybrid Scheduling**: Combination of manual and automated approaches
   - Pre-assign featured matches to specific courts
   - Auto-schedule remaining matches around fixed commitments
   - Apply constraints and preferences via policies

### Prerequisites for Scheduling

Automated scheduling requires:

1. **Venues with Courts**: Define tournament venues and their courts
2. **Date Availability**: Specify when courts are available (dates, times, bookings)
3. **Scheduling Policy**: Define average match times, recovery periods, daily limits
4. **Match Up Formats**: Assign scoring formats to events/matchUps

:::tip Getting Started
Start with venue setup, then define court availability, attach a scheduling policy, and finally run automated scheduling or manually assign schedules.

## Scheduling Workflows

### Local Tournament Workflow

For club or local tournaments with a single venue:

1. Create venue and add courts
2. Define court `dateAvailability` for tournament dates
3. Attach `POLICY_SCHEDULING_DEFAULT` or custom policy
4. Use `scheduleMatchUps()` to schedule rounds individually
5. Review and manually adjust as needed

### Multi-Day Tournament Workflow

For larger tournaments spanning multiple days:

1. Set up venues and court availability
2. Create a `schedulingProfile` defining which rounds play on which days
3. Attach appropriate scheduling policies (format timing, daily limits)
4. Use `scheduleProfileRounds()` for automated scheduling
5. Review conflicts and make manual adjustments
6. Publish schedules to participants

### Professional Tournament Workflow

For professional circuits (ITF, ATP, WTA style):

1. Define multiple venues with detailed court specifications
2. Use **Pro Scheduling** (grid-based) for predictable scheduling
3. Configure **Follow By** scheduling for TV and stadium courts
4. Set up person requests (practice times, media commitments)
5. Apply strict daily limits and recovery time policies
6. Generate preliminary schedules with conflict detection
7. Manual refinement for featured matches
8. Real-time schedule updates as matches complete

### Multi-Tournament Workflow

For circuits or leagues sharing venues:

1. Link tournament records across shared venues
2. Define venue availability across all tournaments
3. Create scheduling profiles for each tournament
4. Use Garman scheduling to optimize court utilization across tournaments
5. Apply cross-tournament conflict detection
6. Coordinate schedules to prevent participant conflicts

## Garman Scheduling

The Competition Factory implements an enhanced version of the Garman scheduling algorithm, which optimally schedules matches to maximize court utilization while respecting constraints.

### Standard Garman Formula

The traditional Garman formula calculates available time slots based on:
- Court availability (start/end times)
- Average match duration
- Number of matches to schedule

**Formula**: `Available Time Slots = (Court Hours × Courts) / Average Match Duration`

### Enhanced Garman Implementation

The Competition Factory extends Garman scheduling to support:

- **Variable match durations**: Different formats have different average times
- **Recovery requirements**: Minimum rest between a player's matches
- **Daily limits**: Maximum matches per player per day
- **Multi-tournament scheduling**: Shared venues across tournaments
- **Court preferences**: Priority courts for featured matches
- **Person requests**: Player-specific scheduling constraints
- **Not-before times**: Matches that can't start before a specific time

### Iterative Garman Scheduling

For complex scheduling scenarios, the engine uses iterative Garman scheduling:

1. **Group Matches**: Group matchUps by average duration
2. **Schedule Block**: Schedule all matches with similar duration
3. **Update Availability**: Recalculate available courts and times
4. **Next Block**: Schedule next group with their duration
5. **Repeat**: Continue until all matches scheduled or constraints exhausted

This approach allows matches of different durations to be efficiently scheduled while maintaining optimal court utilization.

## Scheduling States

MatchUps progress through several scheduling states:

| State | Description | TimeItem Type |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| **Unscheduled** | No scheduling information | None |
| **Date Assigned** | Has `scheduledDate` but no time | `SCHEDULE.DATE` |
| **Time Assigned** | Has `scheduledDate` and `scheduledTime` | `SCHEDULE.TIME` |
| **Venue Assigned** | Assigned to a venue (may or may not have court) | `SCHEDULE.VENUE` |
| **Court Assigned** | Assigned to a specific court | `SCHEDULE.COURT` |
| **In Progress** | Match has started | `STATUS.${matchUpStatus}` |
| **Completed** | Match has finished | `STATUS.COMPLETE` |

:::note Scheduling Flexibility
A matchUp can have a date/time without a venue/court (for preliminary schedules), or a venue/court without a specific time (for on-site day-of scheduling).
:::

## Scheduling Constraints

The system enforces multiple types of constraints:

### Hard Constraints (Must Be Satisfied)

- **Court availability**: Matches can only be scheduled when courts are available
- **Match dependencies**: Later rounds can't be scheduled before earlier rounds complete
- **Venue capacity**: Can't schedule more simultaneous matches than available courts
- **Time feasibility**: Match must fit within court availability window

### Soft Constraints (Should Be Satisfied)

- **Recovery times**: Minimum rest between a player's matches
- **Daily limits**: Maximum matches per player per day  
- **Not-before times**: Preferred start times for matches
- **Court preferences**: Priority courts for seeded players or finals
- **Person requests**: Player-specific preferences or restrictions

### Conflict Detection

The system automatically detects scheduling conflicts:

- **Player conflicts**: Same player scheduled simultaneously
- **Insufficient recovery**: Match scheduled before recovery period expires
- **Daily limit violations**: Player scheduled for too many matches
- **Venue conflicts**: More matches than available courts
- **Booking conflicts**: Scheduled during court booking/reservation

:::tip Conflict Resolution
Use `getParticipants({ scheduleAnalysis: true })` to identify conflicts, then resolve manually or adjust scheduling constraints.
