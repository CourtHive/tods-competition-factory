## Schedule Conflict Reporting

Schedule Conflicts are reported for participants that are returned from `engine.getParticipants`.

The attribute `scheduleConflicts` is an array of objects containing pairs of `matchUpIds`
that have been scheduled at times that conflict with each other based on either the **scheduling policy**
that is in force, or a specified `scheduledMinutesDifference`, which overrides the default behavior.

:::note
`matchUpIds` in the `scheduleConflicts` array may refer to either a participant's `matchUps` or their `potentialMatchUps` which are defined as those `matchUps`
in which they will appear if they either win or lose `matchUps` in which they are already present.
:::

A **scheduling policy** defines average match times for different scoring formats as well as recovery times between **_matchUpTypes_**.
A conflict occurs when a matchUp's `scheduledTime + averageMinutes + recoveryMinutes`, or `endTime + recoveryMinutes` (if available) is greater than the `scheduledTime` of any other participant `matchUp`.

```js
const {
  participants,
  participantIdsWithConflicts, // array of participantIds which have scheduling conflicts
} = engine.getParticipants({
  scheduleAnalysis: {
    scheduledMinutesDifference: 60, // optional - scheduling conflicts determined by scheduledTime difference between matchUps
  },
  withStatistics,
  withOpponents,
  withMatchUps,
});
```
