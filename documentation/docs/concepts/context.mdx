title: Context / Hydration
---

**matchUps** and **participants** can be returned with contextual information that is not part of the TODS document node from which they originated.
The process of adding context is also referred to as "hydration".

Contextual information for `matchUps` includes information about the `structures, drawDefinitions` and `events` within which they are embeded;
`drawPositions` are resolved using `positionAssignments` to the `participants`.

Contextual information for `participants` can include `events, drawDefinitions` and `matchUps` in which each `participant` appears,
as well as `ratings` and `rankings` converted from `timeItems`.

Additional contextual information can be passed into methods for retrieving `matchUps` and `participants` via the `context` attribute,
and any `extensions` can be converted to attributes accessible as attributes beginning with an underscore.

## matchUps

All API calls which return **matchUps** return deep copies with context.
Attributes that are added for **matchUps** include: `structureId, structureName, drawId, eventId, eventName, tournamentId` and `tournamentName`.

All `matchUps` that are returned **inContext** include converted extensions. See **makeDeepCopy** in [Utilities](../utilities/make-deep-copy).

In the **Live Editor** example below, `{ inContext: false }` overrides the default behavior.
Change the value to `true` and compare the `matchUp` objects to see the difference when context is added.

```jsx live
function ContextDemo(props) {
  const { tournamentRecord } = mocksEngine.generateTournamentRecord({
    drawProfiles: [{ drawSize: 4 }],
  });
  tournamentEngine.setState(tournamentRecord);

  const { matchUps } = tournamentEngine.allTournamentMatchUps({
    inContext: false,
  });

  return <MatchUps data={matchUps} />;
}
```

## tournamentParticipants

When participants are returned with `{ withIndividualParticipants: true }`, those that are `participantType` **PAIR, TEAM, or GROUP** include `individualParticipants` derived from `individualParticipantIds`.

```js
const {
  participants,
  participantIdsWithConflicts, // array of participantIds which have scheduling conflicts
} = tournamentEngine.getParticipants({
  convertExtensions: true, // converts extensions to attributes beginning with underscore
  participantFilters: { participantTypes: [PAIR] },
  scheduleAnalysis: { scheduledMinutesDifference },
  withIndividualParticipants: true,
  policyDefinitions,
  withStatistics,
  withOpponents,
  withMatchUps,
});
```
