title: Context
---

When **matchUps** and **tournamentParticipants** are returned **inContext**
it means that they include contextual information that is not part of the TODS document node from which they originated.

## matchUps

All API calls which return **matchUps** return deep copies with context.
Attributes that are added for **matchUps** include: structureId, structureName, drawId, eventId, eventName, tournamentId and tournamentName.

In the **Live Editor** example below, `inContext: false` overrides the default behavior.
Change the value to `true` and compare the `matchUp` objects to see the difference when context is added.

```jsx live
function ContextDemo(props) {
  const { tournamentRecord } = mocksEngine.generateTournamentRecord({
    drawProfiles: [{ drawSize: 4 }],
  });
  tournamentEngine.setState(tournamentRecord);

  const { matchUps } = tournamentEngine.allTournamentMatchUps({
    inContext: false,
  });

  return <MatchUps data={matchUps} />;
}
```

## tournamentParticipants

When participants are returned with `{ inContext: true }`, those that are `participantType` **PAIR, TEAM, or GROUP** include `individualParticipants` derived from `individualParticipantIds`.

Context is also added if `withStatistics, withOpponents, withMatchUps, or scheduleAnalysis` are true.

```js
const {
  tournamentParticipants,
  participantIdsWithConflicts, // array of participantIds which have scheduling conflicts
} = tournamentEngine.getTournamentParticipants({
  inContext: true,

  participantFilters: { participantTypes: [PAIR] },
  scheduleAnalysis: { scheduledMinutesDifference },
  policyDefinition,
  withStatistics,
  withOpponents,
  withMatchUps,
});
```

## Converted Extensions

All elements that are returned **inContext** include converted extensions. See **makeDeepCopy** in [Utilities](../engines/makedeepcopy).
