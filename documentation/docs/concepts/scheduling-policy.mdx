title: Scheduling Policy

## Scheduling Policy Overview

A **Scheduling Policy** defines the foundational parameters that govern how tournaments are scheduled, including:

- Average matchUp duration times for different formats
- Mandated recovery times between matches
- Daily match limits per player
- Venue and court modification restrictions

These policies ensure intelligent scheduling that respects player welfare, venue constraints, and competitive integrity.

## Quick Examples

### Attach Default Policy

```js
import { tournamentEngine, POLICY_SCHEDULING_DEFAULT } from 'tods-competition-factory';

tournamentEngine.setState(tournamentRecord);
tournamentEngine.attachPolicies({
  policyDefinitions: POLICY_SCHEDULING_DEFAULT
});
```

### Override Format Timing

:::tip How it Works
`modifyMatchUpFormatTiming()` adds an extension to the tournament record that is read by scheduling functions to override default policy timing for specific formats. The extension persists at the tournament level and affects all subsequent scheduling operations.
:::

```js
// Set averageTimes for a specific matchUpFormat
engine.modifyMatchUpFormatTiming({
  matchUpFormat: 'SET3-S:6/TB7',
  averageTimes: [
    {
      categoryNames: ['U12', 'U14'],
      minutes: { DOUBLES: 110, default: 130 },
    },
    {
      categoryNames: ['U16', 'U18'],
      minutes: { DOUBLES: 100, default: 120 },
    },
  ],
  recoveryTimes: [{ categoryNames: [], minutes: { default: 15, DOUBLES: 15 } }],
});
```

### Set Daily Limits

:::tip How it Works
`setMatchUpDailyLimits()` adds an extension to the tournament record (or specific tournament in multi-tournament scenarios) that is read by scheduling functions to enforce daily match limits per participant. The extension persists at the tournament level and is checked during all scheduling operations.
:::

```js
// Set tournament-wide daily limits
engine.setMatchUpDailyLimits({
  dailyLimits: { SINGLES: 2, DOUBLES: 1, total: 3 },
});
```

## Common Use Cases

- **Youth Tournaments**: Shorter match times, longer recovery periods, stricter daily limits
- **Wheelchair Events**: Extended match durations with appropriate recovery times
- **Multi-Format Events**: Different timing for preliminary rounds vs. finals
- **Championship Events**: Single-match-per-day restrictions with extended recovery
