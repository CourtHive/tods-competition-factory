Scheduling `matchUps` depends on tournamentRecords having `venues` with `courts` which have defined `dateAvailability` attributes.

A `dateAvailability` definition is an array of objects which define a `startTime` and `endTime` for court availability.
When no date is specified the start and end times apply to all valid tournament dates; defining a `date` attribute scopes the
definition to a specific date.

`dateAvailability` definitions can also contain an array of `bookings` objects which makes courts unavailable to auto-Scheduling
functions during specified blocks of time.

<RenderJSON
  data={dateAvailability}

  expandRoot={true}
  expandToLevel={2}
