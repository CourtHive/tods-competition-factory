## Overview

Scheduling is the process of assigning **dates**, **venues**, **courts** and **times** to tournament `matchUps`.

In TODS, scheduling information is attached to `matchUps` as `timeItems` and the schedule is derived by interrogating the scheduling information attached to `matchUps`.
This approach means that there is no master schedule object; it also means that when `drawDefinitions` or draw `structures` are removed there is no schedule to be cleared.

In the Competition Factory, scheduling is accomplished either direclty via scheduling methods such as `addMatchUpScheduledDate`, or automatically via `scheduleMatchUps` or `scheduleProfileRounds`.

Automated scheduling, along with direct assignment of venues and courts, depends on having venues with courts which have defined `dateAvailability`.

### dateAvailability

A `dateAvailability` definition is an array of objects which define a `startTime` and `endTime` for court availability.
When no date is specified the start and end times apply to all valid tournament dates; defining a `date` attribute scopes the
definition to a specific date.

`dateAvailability` definitions can also contain an array of `bookings` objects which makes courts unavailable to auto-scheduling
functions during specified blocks of time.

<RenderJSON
  data={dateAvailability}
  root={'dateAvailability'}
  colorScheme={'summerfruit'}
  invertTheme={true}
  expandRoot={true}
  expandToLevel={2}

## Iterative Garman scheduling

The `competitionEngine` supports Garman scheduling of `matchUps` from multiple tournaments across shared `venues`.

The Garman formula calculates the times at which `matchUps` may be scheduled, taking into consideration court availability
and average minutes per match, but it does not inherently support the **average minutes** per `matchUp` being **_different_**
across blocks of `matchUps`.

## schedulingProfile

To support the use of the Garman formula for scheduling `matchUps` from different events,
`competitionEngine` makes use of a `schedulingProfile` to define the order of `rounds` of structures within `drawDefinitions`
to be scheduled on specific days, and then iteratively calls the Garman formula.

The `schedulingProfile` is an array of profiles for the `scheduleDates` to be scheduled; it is stored as an `extension` attached to the tournament record.
`competitionEngine` provides convenience methods for creating and manipulting the `schedulingProfile`, or it can be generated externally and attached
via `setSchedulingProfile()`.

Each `scheduleDate` profile object must include the attributes `{ scheduleDate, venues }`, and the `venues` attribute must be an array of venue profile objects
which include the attributes `{ venueId, rounds }`, where `rounds` is an array of objects with the following attributes:

```js
[
  {
    // required
    tournamentId,
    eventId,
    drawId,
    structureId,
    roundNumber,

    //optional
    roundSegment: {
      segmentNumber, // segment which is to be scheduled
      segmentsCount, // number of segments in a round
    },
  },
];
```

### Example

In this example additional attributes have been added by the client applications for display purposes.
They are not required for automated scheduling to function.

<RenderJSON
  data={SchedulingProfile}
  root={'schedulingProfile'}
  colorScheme={'summerfruit'}
  invertTheme={true}
/>

## Scheduling policy

A "Scheduling Policy" defines the average matchUp times and mandated recovery times for each `matchUpFormat`,
and sets limits on the number of matchUps that may be played per-player per-day.

<RenderJSON
  data={SchedulingPolicy}
  root={'scheduling'}
  colorScheme={'summerfruit'}
  invertTheme={true}
/>

## Overriding policies

Average `matchUpFormat` times and recovery times can be defined, or established policies can be overridden

```js
// set averageTimes for a specific matchUpFormat
competitionEngine.modifyMatchUpFormatTiming({
  matchUpFormat: 'SET3-S:6/TB7',
  averageTimes: [
    {
      categoryNames: ['U12', 'U14'],
      minutes: { ['DOUBLES']: 110, default: 130 },
    },
    {
      categoryNames: ['U16', 'U18'],
      minutes: { ['DOUBLES']: 100, default: 120 },
    },
  ],
  recoveryTimes: [
    { categoryNames: [], minutes: { default: 15, ['DOUBLES']: 15 } },
  ],
});

// set dailyLimits
competitionEngine.setMatchUpDailyLimits({
  dailyLimits: { SINGLES: 2, DOUBLES: 1, total: 3 },
});
```

## Automated Scheduling

Once the `schedulingProfile`, `matchUpFormatTiming` and `dailyLimits` have been defined, automated assignment of **scheduleTimes** to `matchUps` is straightforward.

```js
competitionEngine.scheduleProfileRounds({
  scheduleDates, // optional array of dates to be scheduled
});
```

### pseudocode

Scheduling operates with an array of all competition matchUps "inContext".
After building up a mapping of matchUpIds to scheduleTimes, the assignments are made.

1. Loop through `scheduleDates` ...
2. Loop through venues for current `scheduleDate` ...
3. ensure `rounds` specified for `scheduleDate` are sorted as specified
4. Generate ordered array of `matchUpIds` derived from specified `rounds`
5. Group ordered `matchUpIds` by **averageMatchUpMinutes|recoveryMinutes**
6. Loop through groups of `matchUpIds` ...
7. Calculate Available scheduleTimes, considering court availability and already scheduled matchUps
8. Construct per-participant hash tables of `matchUps` played and `timeAfterRecovery`
9. Filter out `matchUps` which are not appropriate for scheduling
10. Filter out `matchUps` which include participants who have reached daily limits
11. Loop through available `scheduleTimes` and build up mapping of `matchUpIds` to `scheduleTimes`
    - Defer scheduling of matchUps where `timeAfterRecovery` has not been reached
    - Defer scheduling of matchUps where `personRequests` include `{ requestType: DO_NO_SCHEDULE }` conflicts
12. Group `matchUpIds` by **eventId|drawId|structureId** and assign `scheduleTimes` to `matchUps`

## Schedule Conflict Reporting

Schedule Conflicts are reported for participants that are returned from `tournamentEngine.getTournamentParticipants`
or `competitionEngine.getCompetitionParticipants`.

The attribute `scheduleConflicts` is an array of objects containing pairs of `matchUpIds`
that have been scheduled at times that conflict with each other based on either the **scheduling policy**
that is in force, or a specified `scheduledMinutesDifference`, which overrides the default behavior.

:::note
`matchUpIds` in the `scheduleConflicts` array may refer to either a participant's `matchUps` or their `potentialMatchUps` which are defined as those `matchUps`
in which they will appear if they either win or lose `matchUps` in which they are already present.
:::

A **scheduling policy** defines average match times for different scoring formats as well as recovery times between **_matchUpTypes_**.
A conflict occurs when a matchUp's `scheduledTime + averageMinutes + recoveryMinutes`, or `endTime + recoveryMinutes` (if available) is greater than the `scheduledTime` of any other participant `matchUp`.

```js
const {
  tournamentParticipants,
  participantIdsWithConflicts, // array of participantIds which have scheduling conflicts
} = tournamentEngine.getTournamentParticipants({
  inContext: true,

  scheduleAnalysis: {
    scheduledMinutesDifference: 60, // optional - scheduling conflicts determined by scheduledTime difference between matchUps
  },
  withStatistics,
  withOpponents,
  withMatchUps,
});
```
