The engines of the Competition Factory preserve the integrity of tourtnament records,
which means that errors are thrown when **invalid** actions are attempted, such as removing an outcome for a matchUp
when participants have already progressed and completed subsequent matchUps in an elimination structure.

In developing a User Interface for interaction with draw structures it is useful to know in advance which actions are **valid**.
The Competition Factory exports two methods via `drawEngine`, and `tournamentEngine` which return not only `validActions`
but also the `methods` to perform each action along with both prepopulated `params` and valid values for `params` which are yet to be defined.
