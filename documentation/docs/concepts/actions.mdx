title: Actions
---

The engines of the Competition Factory preserve the integrity of tourtnament records,
which means that errors are thrown when **invalid** actions are attempted, such as removing an outcome for a matchUp
when participants have already progressed and completed subsequent matchUps in an elimination structure.

In developing a User Interface for interaction with draw structures it is useful to know in advance which actions are **valid**.
The Competition Factory exports two methods which return not only `validActions` but also the `methods` to perform each action,
along with both pre-populated parameters and valid values for parameters which are yet to be defined.

## positionActions

Actions which are relevant to assigned positions within a draw structure.

- **Assign Participant**: Assign accepted/selected participants to specified draw position
- **Set Nickname**: Set a nickname for assigned participant (useful when players have excessively long names or multiple players have the same name)
- **Assign Alternate**: Assign participant from the list of alternates to specified draw position
- **Assign Qualifier**: Assign qualifier from Qualifying structure to specified draw position
- **Assign Lucky Loser**: Assign loser from Qualifying structure to specified draw position
- **Remove Assignment**: Clear specified draw position

- **Assign Bye**: Assign a BYE to specified draw position
- **Set Seed Value**: Assign custom seed value to participant at draw position

- **Swap Participants**: Swap participant at specified draw position with any other positioned participant
- **Modify Pair Assignment**: Modify individual participant within a positioned doubles pair participant
- **Add Penalty**: Record a penalty for participant at specified draw position

**positionActions** are available via `drawEngine` and `tournamentEngine`.
