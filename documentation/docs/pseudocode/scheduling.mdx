## Iterative Garman scheduling

The `competitionEngine` supports Garman scheduling of `matchUps` from multiple tournaments across shared `venues`.

The Garman formula calculates the times at which `matchUps` may be scheduled, taking into consideration court availability
and average minutes per match, but it does not inherently support the **average minutes** per `matchUp` being **_different_**
across blocks of `matchUps`.

## schedulingProfile

To support the use of the Garman formula for scheduling `matchUps` from different events,
`competitionEngine` makes use of a `schedulingProfile` to define the order of `rounds` of structures within `drawDefinitions`
to be scheduled on specific days, and then iteratively calls the Garman formula.

The `schedulingProfile` is an array of profiles for the `dates` to be scheduled; it is stored as an `extension` attached to the tournament record.
`competitionEngine` provides convenience methods for creating and manipulting the `schedulingProfile`, or it can be generated externally and attached
via `setSchedulingProfile()`.

<RenderJSON
  data={SchedulingProfile}
  root={'schedulingProfile'}
  colorScheme={'summerfruit'}
  invertTheme={true}
/>

## Scheduling policy

A "Scheduling Policy" defines the average matchUp times and mandated recovery times for each `matchUpFormat`,
and sets limits on the number of matchUps that may be played per-player per-day.

<RenderJSON
  data={SchedulingPolicy}
  root={'scheduling'}
  colorScheme={'summerfruit'}
  invertTheme={true}
/>

## Overriding policies

Average `matchUpFormat` times and recovery times can be defined, or established policies can be overridden

```js
// set averageTimes for a specific matchUpFormat
competitionEngine.modifyMatchUpFormatTiming({
  matchUpFormat: 'SET3-S:6/TB7',
  averageTimes: [
    {
      categoryNames: ['U12', 'U14'],
      minutes: { ['DOUBLES']: 110, default: 130 },
    },
    {
      categoryNames: ['U16', 'U18'],
      minutes: { ['DOUBLES']: 100, default: 120 },
    },
  ],
  recoveryTimes: [
    { categoryNames: [], minutes: { default: 15, ['DOUBLES']: 15 } },
  ],
});

// set dailyLimits
competitionEngine.setMatchUpDailyLimits({
  dailyLimits: { SINGLES: 2, DOUBLES: 1, total: 3 },
});
```

## Automated Scheduling

Once the `schedulingProfile`, `matchUpFormatTiming` and `dailyLimits` have been defined, automated assignment of **scheduleTimes** to `matchUps` is straightforward.

```js
competitionEngine.scheduleProfileRounds({
  scheduleDates, // optional array of dates to be scheduled
});
```

## pseudocode

Scheduling operates with an array of all competition matchUps "inContext".
After building up a mapping of matchUpIds to scheduleTimes, the assignments are made.

1. Loop through `scheduleDates` ...
2. Loop through venues for current `scheduleDate` ...
3. Insure `rounds` specified for `scheduleDate` are sorted as specified
4. Generate ordered array of `matchUpIds` derived from specified `rounds`
5. Group ordered `matchUpIds` by **averageMatchUpMinutes|recoveryMinutes**
6. Loop through groups of `matchUpIds` ...
7. Calculate Available scheduleTimes, considering court availability and already scheduled matchUps
8. Construct per-participant hash tables of `matchUps` played and `timeAfterRecovery`
9. Filter out `matchUps` which are not appropriate for scheduling
10. Filter out `matchUps` which include participants who have reached daily limits
11. Loop through available `scheduleTimes` and build up mapping of `matchUpIds` to `scheduleTimes`
    - Defer scheduling of matchUps where `timeAfterRecovery` has not been reached
    - Defer scheduling of matchUps where `personRequests` include `{ requestType: DO_NO_SCHEDULE }` conflicts
12. Group `matchUpIds` by **eventId|drawId|structureId** and assign `scheduleTimes` to `matchUps`
