## Iterative Garman Scheduling

The `competitionEngine` supports Garman scheduling of `matchUps` from multiple tournaments across shared `venues`. The Garman formula calculates the times at which `matchUps` may be scheduled, taking into consideration court availability and average minutes per match, but it does not inherently support **average minutes** per `matchUp` being **_different_** across blocks of `matchUps`. To support the use of the Garman formula for scheduling `matchUps` from different events, `competitionEngine` makes use of a `schedulingProfile` to define the order `rounds` of `drawDefinitions` to be scheduled on specific days, and then iteratively calls the Garman formula.

## schedulingProfile

The `scheulingProfile` is an array of profiles for the `dates` to be scheduled; it is stored as an `extension` attached to the tournament record. `competitionEngine` provides convenience methods for creating and manipulting the `schedulingProfile`, or it can be generated externally and attached via `setSchedulingProfile()`.
