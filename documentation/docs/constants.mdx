The Competition Factory uses many constants internally and exports groupings of constants both directly and via `factoryConstants`.

## Include in your project

```js
import { factoryConstants } from 'tods-competition-factory';
```

## Ineteractive Explorer

Use this Live Editor to explore the factory constants. Edit the value of **grouping** to see exported constants.

:::tip
In the **Live Editor**, wthe value of **grouping** is `''` or `undefined`, the list of constants groupings is displayed.
:::

```jsx live
function ExploreConstants(props) {
  // enter the name of a constants grouping from below, e.g. 'entryStatutsConstants'
  const grouping = '';

  return <ConstantsViewer grouping={grouping} />;
}
```
