title: State Engines
---

Competition Factory engines manage different concerns within a tournament and may be used either synchronously or asynchronously.
Engine methods which mutate/transform operate on documents which are held in state.
The **competitionEngine**, **tournamentEngine** and **scaleEngine** share a state which contains one or more _tournamentRecords_;
while the **drawEngine** and **matchUpEngine** have their own state.

By default a deep copy of documents are made as they are loaded into each state engine. This behavior can be overridden such that the engines operate on original documents.

[**competitionEngine**](./engines/competition-engine-overview) - manages resources which may be shared across multiple linked tournaments, such as venues (courts & other locations); includes advanced scheduling and cross-tournament reporting.

[**tournamentEngine**](./engines/tournament-engine-overview) - manages tournament metadata, participants, events (including the generation of complex draw types and "flights" within events), and reporting.

[**drawEngine**](./engines/draw-engine-overview) - generates drawDefinitions and matchUp results; manages participant seeding and movement within and between draw structures.

[**matchUpEngine**](./engines/matchUp-engine-overview) - methods to manipulate tieFormats, analyze arrays of matchUps, and report on matchUp scores.

[**scaleEngine**](./engines/scale-engine-overview) - methods to generate ranking points and calculate ratings.
