title: State Engines
---

Competition Factory engines manage different concerns within a tournament and may be used either synchronously or asynchronously.
Engine methods which mutate/transform operate on documents which are held in state.

The **syncEngine**, **asyncEngine** and **askEngine** all share a state which contains one or more _tournamentRecords_.

By default a deep copy of documents are made as they are loaded into each state engine. This behavior can be overridden such that the engines operate on original documents.

## Governors

**Competition Factory** functions are organized into _governors_ which are responsible for specific areas of concern.

State engines can be used to call factory functions:

```js
import { askEngine, participantGovernor: { getParticipants } } from 'tods-competition-factory';
const { participants } = askEngine.execute({ getParticipants, ...params });
```

...or methods can be imported into shared engine state:

```js
askEngine.importMethods({ getParticipants });
const { participants } = askEngine.getParticipants(params);
// -or-
const { participants } = askEngine.execute({
  method: 'getParticipants',
  params: {},
});
```

```

```
