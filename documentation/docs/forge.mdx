Factory methods are exported directly via `generate`, `transform`, `query` and `utility` packages.

```js
// node REPL
const generate = await import('tods-competition-factory/generate');
const transform = await import('tods-competition-factory/transform');
const query = await import('tods-competition-factory/query');
const utilities = await import('tods-competition-factory/utilities');
```
