Factory methods are exported directly via `generate`, `transform`, `query` and `utility` packages.

```js
const generate = import('tods-competition-factory/generate');
const transform = import('tods-competition-factory/transform');
const query = import('tods-competition-factory/query');
const utilities = import('tods-competition-factory/utilities');
```
