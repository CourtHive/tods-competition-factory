name: Tournament Engine Overview
title: Overview
---

**tournamentEngine** operates on a complete tournament object, or `tournamentRecord`.

```js
import { tournamentEngine } from 'tods-competition-factory';
// -- or --
const { tournamentEngine } = require('tods-competition-factory');
```

The `tournamentEngine` is a state machine that performs mutations on a `tournamentRecord`, which can either be loaded into state or created.

```js
tournamentEngine.newTournamentRecord({ tournamentName: 'New Tournament' });
// -- or ---
tournamentEngine.setState(tournamentRecord);
```

All tournamentEngine methods which make a mutation return either `{ success: true }` or `{ error }`

:::note
Multiple tournamentRecords can be loaded into `competitionEngine`.

`tournamentEngine` can be pointed to different tournamentRecords in the shared state.

```js
tournamentEngine.setTournamentId(tournamentId);
```

:::tip
To operate on a tournamentRecord without loading it into state, it is possible to pass it as a parameter to any engine method:

```js
tournamentEngine.getTournamentParticipants({
  sandboxTournament: tournamentRecord,
});
```
