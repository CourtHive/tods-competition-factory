A **seeding policy** specifies how many seeds to allow per draw size and how seeds are to be positioned within a draw structure;
it may also instruct the `drawEngine` to disallow the placement of seed numbers in positions which are not defined as seeded positions,
as well as indicate that duplicate seed numbers may be used.

## seedingProfile

There are two **seedingProfile** patterns supported by the `drawEngine` for elimination structures: "CLUSTER" and "SEPARATE".
`seedingProfile.positioning` determines which draw positions appear in **seedBlocks**.

"CLUSTER" indicates the positioning used by the **ITF**, while "SEPARATE" indicates the positioning used by the **USTA**.

In **ITF** draws, seeded posiitions can appear next to each other (though the positions are part
of different eights, for instance). In **USTA** draws there is always an even separation, with seeded positions in
the top half of of a draw at the top of position groups, and seeded positions in the bottom half of a draw
at the bottom of position groups.

`seedingProfile.groupSeedingThreshold` will set seedValue to lowest value within all groups where seedNumber is > threshold

### Seed Blocks

A Seed Block is a grouping of positions used for placement of seeded participants.
For a typical **ITF** elimination structure with a draw size of 32, the seed blocks follow the pattern:

```js
[1], [32], [9, 24], [8, 16, 17, 25], ...
```

The first and second seeds are always in their own seed block, which means participants with these seed assignments have fixed positions.
The third and fourth seeds are in a seed block together; the positions within the block are assigned at random to the seeded participants.
The fifth through eighth seeds have a block of four possible positions, and so forth.

## seedCountThresholds and drawSizeProgression

Objects in the `seedCountThresholds` array determine `seedsCount`, the number of seeds which are allowed for each `drawSize`, by defining a `minimumParticpantCount`.

- When `drawSizeProgression` is **true**, thresholds for smaller drawSizes are applied to larger drawSizes.
- When `drawSizeProgression` is **false** it is possible to have more granular control of the policy for each `drawSize`.

## duplicateSeedNumbers

Some providers prefer for participants in a **seedBlock** such as [5, 6, 7, 8] to all appear with the same **seedValue**.
This implies that even though `seedNumbers` may be assigned by **ranking** or **rating**, participants within a **seedBlock** should be considered equal.

`{ duplicateSeedNumbers: true }` allows auto seeding methods to randomly select the order in which participants in a **seedBlock** are placed.
For standard Elimination structures this is meaningless, but in Round Robin and Staggered Entry structures particpant placments can vary.

## Seed Assignments

Every draw structure uses `seedAssignments` to associate unique `participantIds` with unique `seedNumbers`.

:::note
Only one `participantId` may be assigned to each `seedNumber`, but each seed assignment may have a custom `seedValue`. This supports
scenarios where the fifth throught the eighth seeds appear with a value of **'5-8'**; some providers even choose
to display numerous participants with the same seed number on a draw... if five particpants have equivalent rankings they could all appear
as seed **"4"**, even though one of those five would get a position from the 3-4 seedblock and four of the five would be assigned
positions from the 5-8 seed block.
