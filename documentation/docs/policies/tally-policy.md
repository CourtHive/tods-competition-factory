title: Round Robin Tally Policy
---

A **Tally Policy** controls how order is determined for Round Robin groups.

Policy Definitions can be attached to a [tournament record](../apis/tournament-engine-api#attachpolicies), or an [event](../apis/tournament-engine-api#attacheventpolicies).

```js
const roundRobinTally = {
  groupOrderKey: 'matchUpsWon', // possible to group by matchUpsWon, setsWon, gamesWon, or pointsWon
  headToHead: {
    disabled: false,
    tallyDirectives: [
      // these are the default values if no tallyDirectives provided; edit to suit
      // idsFilter scopes the tally calculations to only tied participants
      // with { idsFilter: false } the ratio is calculated from all group matchUps
      // with { idsFilter: true } the ratio is calculated from matchUps including tied participants
      // any attribute/idsFilter combination can be selectively disabled for Head to Head calculations
      { attribute: 'matchUpsRatio', idsFilter: false, disbleHeadToHead: false },
      { attribute: 'setsRatio', idsFilter: false, disbleHeadToHead: false },
      { attribute: 'gamesRatio', idsFilter: false, disbleHeadToHead: false },
      { attribute: 'pointsRatio', idsFilter: false, disbleHeadToHead: false },
      { attribute: 'matchUpsRatio', idsFilter: true, disbleHeadToHead: false },
      { attribute: 'setsRatio', idsFilter: true, disbleHeadToHead: false },
      { attribute: 'gamesRatio', idsFilter: true, disbleHeadToHead: false },
      { attribute: 'pointsRatio', idsFilter: true, disbleHeadToHead: false },
    ],
  },
  disqualifyDefaults: true, // disqualified participants are pushed to the bottom of the group order
  disqualifyWalkovers: true, // disqualified participants are pushed to the bottom of the group order
  setsCreditForDefaults: true, // whether or not to award e.g. 2 sets won for player who wins by opponent DEFAULT
  setsCreditForWalkovers: true, // whether or not to award e.g. 2 sets won for player who wins by opponent WALKOVER
  gamesCreditForDefaults: true, // whether or not to award e.g. 12 games won for player who wins by opponent DEFAULT
  gamesCreditForWalkovers: true, // whether or not to award e.g. 12 games won for player who wins by opponent WALKOVER
  GEMscore: ['matchUpsRatio', 'setsRatio', 'gamesRatio', 'pointsRatio'],
};

tournamentEngine.attachPolicies({ policyDefinitions: { roundRobinTally } });
```

## Default Behavior

Round Robin group tally logic by default implements the following guidelines:

1. The player who wins the most matches is the winner.
2. If two players are tied, then the winner of their head-to-head match is the winner.

If three or more players are tied, tie are broken as follows:

- The head-to-head win-loss record in matches involving just the tied players;
- The player with the highest percentage of sets won of all sets completed;
- The head-to-head win-loss record in matches involving the players who remain tied;
- The player with the highest percentage of games won of all games completed;
- The head-to-head win-loss record in matches involving the players who remain tied;
- The player with the highest percentage of sets won of sets completed among players in the group under consideration;
- The head-to-head win-loss record in matches involving the players who remain tied;
- The player with the highest percentage of games won of games completed among the players under consideration; and
- The head-to-head win-loss record in matches involving the players who remain tied.

## Implementation Details

After initial separation of participants by `matchUpsWon`,
the implementation is configurable by supplying an array of `tallyDirectives` in the **Tally Policy**.

The algorithm relies on the values availble in the calculated `participantResults` and works as follows:

- separate participants into groups by a given attribute
- a group with a single participant is 'resolved'
- groups of two participants are resolved by head-to-head (if not disabled/if participants faced each other)
- groups of three or more search for an attribute that will separate them into smaller groups
- participantResults scoped to the members of a group and recalculated when `{ idsFilter: true }`
