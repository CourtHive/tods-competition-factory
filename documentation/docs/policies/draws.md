title: Draws Policy
---

The **Draws Policy** (`POLICY_TYPE_DRAWS`) controls draw type coercion rules, including minimum participant requirements for specific draw types. This policy helps prevent inappropriate draw type selection based on participant count.

**Policy Type:** `draws`

**When to Use:**
- Setting minimum participants for Round Robin with Playoffs
- Preventing automatic draw type coercion
- Enforcing draw type requirements per federation rules
- Customizing draw type selection logic

---

## Policy Structure

```ts
{
  draws: {
    policyName?: string;                    // Optional policy identifier
    
    // Draw type coercion rules
    drawTypeCoercion?: boolean | {
      [drawType: string]: number;           // Minimum participants for each draw type
    };
  }
}
```

**Attributes:**

- **drawTypeCoercion**: Controls automatic draw type adjustments
  - `false` - Disables all draw type coercion
  - `true` - Enables default coercion rules (default behavior)
  - `Object` - Custom minimum participant counts per draw type

---

## Default Policy

```js
import { POLICY_DRAWS_DEFAULT } from 'tods-competition-factory';

// Default: Empty policy (coercion enabled with system defaults)
// {
//   draws: {
//     // drawTypeCoercion: true (default - not specified)
//   }
// }
```

---

## Basic Examples

### Disable All Coercion

```js
import { POLICY_TYPE_DRAWS } from 'tods-competition-factory';

// Prevent any automatic draw type changes
const noCoercionPolicy = {
  [POLICY_TYPE_DRAWS]: {
    policyName: 'No Coercion',
    drawTypeCoercion: false  // No automatic adjustments
  }
};

tournamentEngine.attachPolicies({
  policyDefinitions: noCoercionPolicy
});

// Draw type will be exactly as specified, even if inappropriate
```

### Set Minimum Participants for Round Robin with Playoff

```js
// Require at least 5 participants for Round Robin with Playoff
const roundRobinMinimumPolicy = {
  [POLICY_TYPE_DRAWS]: {
    policyName: 'Round Robin Minimum',
    drawTypeCoercion: {
      ROUND_ROBIN_WITH_PLAYOFF: 5  // Min 5 participants
    }
  }
};

tournamentEngine.attachPolicies({
  policyDefinitions: roundRobinMinimumPolicy
});

// Attempt to create ROUND_ROBIN_WITH_PLAYOFF with 4 participants
const result = tournamentEngine.generateDrawDefinition({
  drawType: 'ROUND_ROBIN_WITH_PLAYOFF',
  drawSize: 4,  // Below minimum
  eventId: 'event-1'
});

// Result: Draw type may be coerced to simpler Round Robin
```

---

## Draw Type Coercion Examples

### Custom Minimums for Multiple Draw Types

```js
const customDrawMinimumsPolicy = {
  [POLICY_TYPE_DRAWS]: {
    policyName: 'Custom Draw Minimums',
    drawTypeCoercion: {
      ROUND_ROBIN_WITH_PLAYOFF: 5,    // Min 5 for RR with playoff
      COMPASS: 8,                      // Min 8 for compass draw
      MODIFIED_FEED_IN_CHAMPIONSHIP: 8 // Min 8 for modified feed-in
    }
  }
};

tournamentEngine.attachPolicies({
  policyDefinitions: customDrawMinimumsPolicy
});

// Below-minimum requests will be coerced to simpler draw types
```

### Federation-Specific Rules

```js
// ITF: Prefer Round Robin with Playoff for smaller groups
const itfDrawPolicy = {
  [POLICY_TYPE_DRAWS]: {
    policyName: 'ITF Draw Policy',
    drawTypeCoercion: {
      ROUND_ROBIN_WITH_PLAYOFF: 4  // Allow RR+playoff with as few as 4
    }
  }
};

// USTA: Require more participants for complex draws
const ustaDrawPolicy = {
  [POLICY_TYPE_DRAWS]: {
    policyName: 'USTA Draw Policy',
    drawTypeCoercion: {
      ROUND_ROBIN_WITH_PLAYOFF: 6,  // Minimum 6 participants
      COMPASS: 16                    // Full compass draw only
    }
  }
};
```

---

## Real-World Examples

### Club Tournament (Flexible)

```js
// Club tournaments often have small draws - be flexible
const clubDrawPolicy = {
  [POLICY_TYPE_DRAWS]: {
    policyName: 'Club Flexibility',
    drawTypeCoercion: {
      ROUND_ROBIN_WITH_PLAYOFF: 3  // Allow very small RR+playoff
    }
  }
};
```

### Professional Event (Strict)

```js
// Professional events require proper draw sizes
const professionalDrawPolicy = {
  [POLICY_TYPE_DRAWS]: {
    policyName: 'Professional Standards',
    drawTypeCoercion: {
      ROUND_ROBIN_WITH_PLAYOFF: 8,     // Full groups required
      COMPASS: 16,                      // Full compass only
      MODIFIED_FEED_IN_CHAMPIONSHIP: 16 // Full feed-in only
    }
  }
};
```

### Development/Testing (No Coercion)

```js
// Testing environment - allow any draw configuration
const testingDrawPolicy = {
  [POLICY_TYPE_DRAWS]: {
    policyName: 'Testing Policy',
    drawTypeCoercion: false  // No restrictions
  }
};

// Useful for:
// - Unit testing edge cases
// - Demonstrating draw structures
// - Debugging draw generation logic
```

## Draw Type Minimum Recommendations

Based on draw structure requirements:

| Draw Type | Recommended Minimum | Notes |
|-----------|-------------------|-------|
| SINGLE_ELIMINATION | 2 | Any number works |
| DOUBLE_ELIMINATION | 4 | 2 players not meaningful |
| ROUND_ROBIN | 2 | Any number works |
| ROUND_ROBIN_WITH_PLAYOFF | 4-6 | Need enough for groups + playoff |
| COMPASS | 8 | Requires proper bracket structure |
| FEED_IN | 4 | Need losers to feed |
| MODIFIED_FEED_IN_CHAMPIONSHIP | 8 | Complex structure |
| CURTIS_CONSOLATION | 8 | Proper consolation brackets |

---

## Policy Behavior

### When Coercion is Disabled (false)

```js
drawTypeCoercion: false

// Behavior:
// - System uses exact draw type specified
// - No automatic adjustments
// - May result in invalid/awkward draws
// - Tournament director has full control
```

### When Coercion is Enabled (true or object)

```js
drawTypeCoercion: true  // OR
drawTypeCoercion: { ROUND_ROBIN_WITH_PLAYOFF: 5 }

// Behavior:
// - System checks participant count
// - Compares against minimums
// - Automatically adjusts to simpler draw type if needed
// - Ensures draw structure integrity
```

---

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Small Draw Size

```js
// Policy requires minimum 5 for RR+playoff
drawTypeCoercion: { ROUND_ROBIN_WITH_PLAYOFF: 5 }

// Request: ROUND_ROBIN_WITH_PLAYOFF with 4 participants
tournamentEngine.generateDrawDefinition({
  drawType: 'ROUND_ROBIN_WITH_PLAYOFF',
  drawSize: 4,
  eventId: 'event-1'
});

// Result: Coerced to ROUND_ROBIN (simpler)
// Reason: 4 < 5 minimum
```

### Scenario 2: Exact Minimum

```js
// Policy requires minimum 5
drawTypeCoercion: { ROUND_ROBIN_WITH_PLAYOFF: 5 }

// Request: ROUND_ROBIN_WITH_PLAYOFF with 5 participants
tournamentEngine.generateDrawDefinition({
  drawType: 'ROUND_ROBIN_WITH_PLAYOFF',
  drawSize: 5,
  eventId: 'event-1'
});

// Result: ROUND_ROBIN_WITH_PLAYOFF as requested
// Reason: 5 >= 5 minimum
```

### Scenario 3: Coercion Disabled

```js
// No coercion
drawTypeCoercion: false

// Request: ROUND_ROBIN_WITH_PLAYOFF with 2 participants
tournamentEngine.generateDrawDefinition({
  drawType: 'ROUND_ROBIN_WITH_PLAYOFF',
  drawSize: 2,
  eventId: 'event-1'
});

// Result: ROUND_ROBIN_WITH_PLAYOFF as requested (even though impractical)
// Reason: Coercion disabled
```

---

## Event-Specific Draw Policies

```js
// Tournament-wide: Be strict
tournamentEngine.attachPolicies({
  policyDefinitions: {
    [POLICY_TYPE_DRAWS]: {
      drawTypeCoercion: {
        ROUND_ROBIN_WITH_PLAYOFF: 8
      }
    }
  }
});

// Consolation event: Be flexible
tournamentEngine.attachPolicies({
  policyDefinitions: {
    [POLICY_TYPE_DRAWS]: {
      drawTypeCoercion: {
        ROUND_ROBIN_WITH_PLAYOFF: 4  // Smaller groups OK
      }
    }
  },
  eventId: 'consolation-event-id'
});
```

---

## Notes

- **Default behavior**: Coercion enabled with system defaults
- **false disables all coercion**: Exact draw types used
- **Object sets custom minimums**: Per draw type control
- Only specified draw types in object are affected
- Draw types not in policy use system defaults
- Coercion happens during draw generation
- No error thrown - draw type silently adjusted
- Tournament directors should be notified of coercion
- Policy applies at generation time, not retroactively
- Event-level policy overrides tournament policy
- Useful for preventing inappropriate draw selections
- Testing/development often uses `drawTypeCoercion: false`

## Draw Type Constants

```js
import {
  SINGLE_ELIMINATION,
  DOUBLE_ELIMINATION,
  ROUND_ROBIN,
  ROUND_ROBIN_WITH_PLAYOFF,
  COMPASS,
  FEED_IN,
  MODIFIED_FEED_IN_CHAMPIONSHIP,
  CURTIS_CONSOLATION
} from 'tods-competition-factory';

    drawTypeCoercion: {
      [ROUND_ROBIN_WITH_PLAYOFF]: 5,
      [COMPASS]: 8
