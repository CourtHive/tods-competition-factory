title: State Engines
---

**Competition Factory** engines share a state which contains one or more `tournamentRecords` and any factory functions which have been imported from [Governors](/docs/governors/governors-overview).

All factory engines provide logging and middleware services which resolve parameters such as `events` and `drawDefinitions` from identifiers.
Mutation engines provide subscription/notification functionality.

- **askEngine**: used to _synchronously_ query `tournamentRecords` held in state.
- **syncEngine**: used to _synchronously_ mutate `tournamentRecords` held in state.
- **asyncEngine**: used to _asynchronously_ mutate `tournamentRecords` held in state.

:::note
All engine methods which make a mutation return either `{ success: true }` or `{ error }`
:::

## Engine state

By default, a "deep copy" of `tournamentRecords` is made as they are loaded into shared state.

- `engine.setState(tournamentRecord)`
- `engine.setState(tournamentRecords)`

This behavior can be overridden such that engines operate directly on loaded tournamentRecords.

- `engine.setState(tournamentRecord, deepCopyOptions)`

**deepCopyOptions** can be either a boolean or an object which configures the behavior of the deep copy.

## Invoking Factory Functions

State engines can be used to invoke factory functions in three ways:

- **execute**: invoke a factory function directly, parameters passed into `execute` method
- **import and execute**: invoke an imported function as an engine attribute
- **import and execute by name**: invoke an imported function by reference
- **executionQueue**: invoke an imported function as part of a queue of functions

## Examples

For each of the following examples `askEngine` and the `getParticipants` method are first imported from the factory.

```js
import { askEngine, participantGovernor: { getParticipants } } from 'tods-competition-factory';

// load a tournamentRecord into state
askEngine.setState(tournamentRecord);
```

### Execute

Function is invoked directly, parameters passed into `execute` method.

```js
const { participants } = askEngine.execute({ getParticipants, ...params });
```

### Import and Execute

Function is imported and invoked as an engine attribute.

```js
askEngine.importMethods({ getParticipants });
const { participants } = askEngine.getParticipants({ withIndividualParticipants: true });
```

### Import and Execute by Name

Function is imported and invoked by reference.

```js
askEngine.importMethods({ getParticipants });
const { participants } = askEngine.execute({
  params: { participantFilters: { participantTypes: [PAIR] } },
  method: 'getParticipants',
});
```

### Execution Queue

Function is imported and invoked as part of a queue of functions.

```js
askEngine.importMethods({ getParticipants });
const result = askEngine.executionQueue([
  { method: 'getParticipants', params: { participantFilters: { participantTypes: [INDIVIDUAL] } } },
]);
const { participants } = result[0];
```

## devContext

**devConext** is a property of engine state which is used to store any data which is useful for development purposes.

- The devContext value can be either a boolean or an object.
- When there is a devContext value present, the `try {} catch {}` block is **NOT** used in method invocation.
- When devContext is an object it is used to configure engine logging.

```js
askEngine.devContext(true); // default
askEngine.devContext(false); // do not catch internal errors
```

## Bypassing State

Passing `tournamentRecord` as a parameter to any engine method will operate directly on the passed `tournamentRecord`.

```js
askEngine.getParticipants({ tournamentRecord });
```

:::info
When `tournamentRecord` is passed as a parameter, a temporary `tournamentRecords` object is created and any `tournamentRecords` in state are not referenced.
