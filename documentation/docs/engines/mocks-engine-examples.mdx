### Simple Example

Generates a tournament record with 32 participants.

```js
const { tournamentRecord } = mocksEngine.generateTournamentRecord();
```

## drawProfiles

In testing, very specific scenarios are required. Any number of draws can be added to a generated tournament, and scores for specific `matchUps` within the generated draw structures can be added as well.

:::note
`drawProfiles` may contain any of the parameters normally passed to `tournamentEngine.generateDrawDefinition`,
with the addition of `{ withPlayoffs }` which may contain any of the parameters passed to `tournamentEngine.addPlayoffStructures()`.

Additionally, the parameter `idPrefix` may be used to define a string value to prepend generated `matchUpIds`, which will then include `roundNumber` and `roundPosition`.
:::

:::info
The completed `matchUps` in this example may be found by navigating in the **Result** panel below:

`tournamentRecord => events[0] => drawDefinitions[0] => structures[0]`
:::

```jsx live
function MocksEngineDemo(props) {
  const drawProfiles = [
    { drawSize: 8, eventType: 'DOUBLES' },
    { drawSize: 4, drawType: 'ROUND_ROBIN' },
  ];
  const { tournamentRecord } = mocksEngine.generateTournamentRecord({
    completeAllMatchUps: true,
    drawProfiles,
  });

  return <Tournament data={tournamentRecord} />;
}
```

### score completion

In the following example a Doubles draw with 32 positions is generated with 30 PAIR participants, leaving two positions to be filled with BYEs. The score for the second `matchUp` in the first round is completed.

```jsx live
function MocksEngineDemo(props) {
  const drawProfiles = [
    {
      drawSize: 32,
      participantsCount: 30,
      participantType: 'PAIR',
      outcomes: [
        {
          roundNumber: 1,
          roundPosition: 2,
          scoreString: '6-1 6-2',
          winningSide: 1,
        },
      ],
    },
  ];

  const { tournamentRecord } = mocksEngine.generateTournamentRecord({
    drawProfiles,
  });

  return <Tournament data={tournamentRecord} />;
}
```

## eventProfiles

**eventProfiles** enable multiple draws to be generated in a single event.

```js
const eventProfiles = [
  {
    eventName: 'Event Flights Test',
    eventType: SINGLES,
    category: {
      categoryName: 'U12',
    },
    matchUpFormat: FORMAT_STANDARD,
    drawProfiles: [
      {
        drawSize: 16,
        drawName: 'Qualifying Draw',
        stage: QUALIFYING,
      },
      {
        drawSize: 32,
        qualifyingPositions: 4,
        drawName: 'Main Draw',
        drawType: COMPASS,
      },
      {
        drawName: 'Consolation Draw',
        stage: VOLUNTARY_CONSOLATION,
      },
    ],
  },
];
const {
  eventIds: [eventId],
  drawIds,
} = mocksEngine.generateTournamentRecord({
  eventProfiles,
});
```
