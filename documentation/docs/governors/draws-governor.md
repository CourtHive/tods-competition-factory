title: Draws Governor
---

```js
import { drawsGovernor } from 'tods-competition-factory';
```

## addAdHocMatchUps

Adds `matchUps` generated by [generateAdHocMatchUps](/docs/governors/generation-governor/#generateadhocmatchups) to specified structure within an AD_HOC `drawDefinition`.

```js
engine.addAdHocMatchUps({
  structureId, // optional if there is only one structure in drawDefinition
  matchUps,
  drawId,
});
```

---

## adHocPositionSwap

Swaps `participant` assignments in two unscored `matchUps` that are part of the same `roundNumber` in and AD_HOC `structure`.
This method and one of the two `participantIds` are returned in `validActions` by `positionActions` which calls `adHocMatchUpActions`, meaning this method is not normally called directly.

```js
engine.adHocPositionSwap({
  participantIds,
  structureId,
  roundNumber,
  drawId,
});
```

---

## addPlayoffStructures

Adds playoff structures to an existing drawDefinition.

```js
engine.addPlayoffStructures({
  drawId,
  structureId,
  roundNumbers: [3], // required if no playoffPositions - source roundNumbers which will feed target structures, e.g. [1, 2]
  roundProfiles, // optional - source roundNumbers as Object.keys with depth as Object.values, e.g. [{ 1: 2}, {2: 1}]
  playoffPositions: [3, 4], // required if not provided roundNumbers
  playoffAttributes, // optional - mapping of either exitProfile or finishingPositionRange to structure names, e.g. 0-1-1 for South
  exitProfileLimit, // limit playoff rounds generated by the attributes present in playoffAttributes
  playoffStructureNameBase, // optional - base word for default playoff naming, e.g. 'Playoff'
});

// example use of playoffAttributes - will generated playoff structure from 2nd round with structureName: 'BRONZE'
const playoffAttributes = {
  '0-2': { name: 'BRONZE', abbreviation: 'B' },
};
```

---

## addQualifyingStructure

```js
engine.addQualifyingStructure({
  targetStructureId, // required: structure for which participants will qualify
  qualifyingPositions, // optional: specify the # of qualifyingPositions
  qualifyingRoundNumber, // optional: determine qualifyingPositions by # of matchUps in specified round; does not apply to ROUND_ROBIN
  structureOptions, // optional: specific to ROUND_ROBIN generation
  structureName, // optional
  drawSize,
  drawType, // optional: defaults to SINGLE_ELIMINATION
  drawId, // required: draw within which target structure appears
});
```

---

## addVoluntaryConsolationStage

Modifies the entryProfile for a draw to allow `{ entryStage: VOLUNTARY_CONSOLATION }`

```js
engine.addVoluntaryConsolationStage({
  drawSize,
  drawId,
});
```

---

## addVoluntaryConsolationStructure

Generates a new structure within a `drawDefinition` if any draw entries are present for `{ entryStage: VOLUNTARY_CONSOLATION }`.

```js
engine.addVoluntaryConsolationStructure({
  structureAbbreviation, // optional
  structureName, // optional - defaults to 'VOLUNTARY_CONSOLATION'
  drawId,
});
```

---

## alternateDrawPositionAssignment

Replaces an existing drawPosition assignment with an alternateParticipantId. This method is included in `validActions` for [positionActions](../policies/positionActions)

```js
engine.alternateDrawPositionAssignment({
  alternateParticipantId,
  drawPosition,
  structureId,
  drawId,

  drawId,
  bye, // optional boolean, if assigning a bye
});
```

---

## assignDrawPositionBye

```js
engine.assignDrawPositionBye({
  structureId,
  drawId,
});
```

---

## attachPlayoffStructures

Attaches the results of `generateAndPopulatePlayoffStructures` to a `drawDefinition`.

:::note
`engine.addPlayoffStructures()` calls both `generateAndPopulatePlayoffStructures` and `attachPlayoffStructures`.
:::

```js
engine.attachPlayoffStructures({
  matchUpModifications, // optional - pass any modifications external to the structure that are relevant to structure generation
  structures,
  drawId,
  links,
});
```

---

## attachQualifyingStructure

```js
engine.attachQualifyingStructure({
  structure, // required: structure object; see `generateQualifyingStructure`
  drawId, // required: id of drawDedfinition to which structure will be attached
  link, // required
});
```

---

## attachStructures

Use to attach structures and links which are generated by `generateVoluntaryConsolation`.

```js
engine.attachStructures({
  matchUpModifications, // optional - pass any modifications external to the structure that are relevant to structure generation
  structures,
  drawId,
  links,
});
```

---

## automatedPlayoffPositioning

For Round Robin structures, uses Round Robin Tallies to position participants in playoff structure(s).

```js
engine.automatedPlayoffPositioning({
  structureId: mainStructure.structureId,
  provisionalPositioning, // optional boolean, defaults to false; when true will honor provisionalOrder if no groupOrder is found in tallyResults
  applyPositioning, // optional boolean, defaults to true; when false will return positioning but not apply it to playoff structures
  drawId,
});
```

---

## automatedPositioning

Positions participants in a draw structure.

See [Policies](../concepts/policies).

```js
engine.automatedPositioning({ drawId, structureId });
```

---

## autoSeeding

:::note
Only generates seeding. To apply `engine.setParticipantScaleItems({ scaleItemsWithParticipantIds }`.
:::

```js
const { scaleItemsWithParticipantIds } = engine.autoSeeding({
  policyDefinitions, // seeding policyDefinition determines the # of seeds for given participantsCount/drawSize
  scaleAttributes, // { scaleType, scaleName, eventType, accessor }
  scaleName, // Optional - defaults to scaleAttributes.scaleName
  drawSize, // Optional - defaults to calculation based on # of entries
  eventId, // required - necessary for resolving entries
  drawId, // Optional - will use flight.drawEntries or drawDefinition.entries rather than event.entries
  stage, // Optional - filters entries by specified stage

  scaleSortMethod, // Optional - user defined sorting method
  sortDescending, // Optional - defaults to false
});

engine.setParticipantScaleItems({
  scaleItemsWithParticipantIds,
});
```

---

## deleteAdHocMatchUps

```js
const result = engine.deleteAdHocMatchUps({
  structureId, // optional optimization - structureId of structure from which matchUps are being deleted
  matchUpIds, // array of matchUpIds identifying matchUps to be deleted
  drawId, // required - drawId of drawDefinition in which target structure is found
});
```

---

## luckyLoserDrawPositionAssignment

Replaces an existing drawPosition assignment with a luckyLoserParticipantId. This method is included in `validActions` for [positionActions](../policies/positionActions)

```js
engine.luckyLoserDrawPositionAssignment({
  luckyLoserParticipantId,
  drawPosition,
  structureId,
  drawId,
});
```

---

## modifyDrawDefinition

```js
engine.modifyDrawDefinition({
  drawUpdates: { policyDefinitions: { ...policies } },
  drawName: 'League Play',
  drawId,
});
```

---

## modifySeedAssignment

Change the display representation of a seedNumber for a specified `participantId`. This method is included in `validActions` for [positionActions](../policies/positionActions).

The rationale for `seedValue` is to be able to, for instance, represent the fifth through the eighth seed as `5-8`, or simply as `5`. When there are no restrictions on seed positioning `seedValue` allows assigning seeding to arbitrary `participants`.

```js
engine.modifySeedAssignment({
  participantId,
  structureId,
  seedValue, // display representation such as '5-8'
  drawId,
});
```

---

## qualifierDrawPositionAssignment

Replaces an existing drawPosition assignment with a qualifierParticipantId. This method is included in `validActions` for [positionActions](../policies/positionActions)

```js
engine.qualifierDrawPositionAssignment({
  qualifierParticipantId,
  drawPosition,
  structureId,
  drawId,
});
```

---

## qualifiersProgression

Randomly replaces existing qualifier drawPosition assignments in the MAIN draw with qualified participants from the QUALIFYING draw.

Fills as many qualifier drawPositions as possible with qualified participants, e.g. if there are 4 qualifier drawPositions and 2 currently qualified participants, only 2 will be assigned.

```js
engine.qualifierProgression({
  drawId,
  eventId,
  targetRoundNumber, // optional - defaults to 1
  tournamentId,
  randomList // optional - array of integers to set assignment order, e.g. [2,3,1,0]. generate with getRandomQualifierList()
});
```

---

## removeDrawDefinitionExtension

```js
engine.removeDrawDefintionExtension({ eventId, drawId, name });
```

---

## removeDrawPositionAssignment

Clear draw position and optionally replace with a BYE, change entryStatus, or decompose a PAIR participant into UNGROUPED participants (DOUBLES only).

```js
engine.removeDrawPositionAssignment({
  drawDefinition,
  structureId,
  drawPosition,
  replaceWithBye, // optional
  entryStatus, // optional - change the entryStatus of the removed participant
  destroyPair, // optional - decompose PAIR participant into UNGROUPED participants
});
```

---

## removeDrawEntries

Removes participantIds from `drawDefinition.entries` (if generated) as well as any relevent `flightProfile.flights`.

```js
engine.removeDrawEntries({
  autoEntryPositions, // optional - keeps entries ordered by entryStage/entryStatus and auto-increments
  participantIds
  eventId,
  stages, // optional array of stages to consider, e.g. [VOLUNTARY_CONSOLATION]
  drawId,
  });
```

---

## removeRoundMatchUps

```js
const {
  deltedMatchUpsCount, // number
  roundRemoved, // boolean
  success, // boolean
  error, // if any
} = engine.removeRoundMatchUps({
  removeCompletedMatchUps, // optional boolean - whether to remove completed matchUps
  roundNumber, // required - roundNumber to remove
  structureId, // required
  drawId, // required
});
```

---

## removeStructure

Removes targeted `drawDefinition.structure` and all other child `structures` along with all associated `drawDefinition.links`.

```js
const { removedMatchUpIds } = engine.removeStructure({
  structureId,
  drawId,
});
```

---

## renameStructures

```js
engine.renameStructures({
  structureDetails: [{ structureId, structureName }],
  drawId,
});
```

---

## resetDrawDefinition

```js
engine.resetDrawDefinition({ drawId });
```

---

## resetQualifyingStructure

```js
engine.resetQualifyingStructure({ structureId, drawId });
```

--

## resetVoluntaryConsolationStructure

```js
engine.resetVoluntaryConsolationStructure({
  resetEntries, // optional - remove all { entryStage: VOLUNTARY_CONSOLATION }
  drawId,
});
```

---

## resetQualifyingStructure

```js
engine.resetQualifyingStructure({
  drawId,
  structureId,
});
```

---

## setDrawParticipantRepresentativeIds

Set the participantIds of participants in the draw who are representing players by observing the creation of the draw.

```js
engine.setDrawParticipantRepresentativeIds({
  representativeParticipantIds,
  drawId,
});
```

---

## setPositionAssignments

Intended to be used in conjunction with `automatedPlayoffPositioning` in deployments where a client instance gets the positioning which is then set on both the client and the server, to ensure that both client and server are identical. If `automatedPlayoffPositioning` is invoked on both client and server independently then it is likely that the positioning on client and server will be different.

```js
// executed only on the client
const { structurePositionAssignments } = engine.automatedPlayoffPositioning({
  applyPositioning: false, // instructs factory engine to only return values, not apply them
  structureId,
  drawId,
});

// executed on both client and server
result = engine.setPositionAssignments({
  structurePositionAssignments,
  drawId,
});
```

---

## setSubOrder

Used to order ROUND_ROBIN participants when finishingPosition ties cannot be broken algorithmically. Assigns a `subOrder` value to a participant within a `structure` by `drawPosition`.

```js
engine.setSubOrder({
  drawPosition: 1,
  subOrder: 2,
  structureId,
  drawId,
});
```

---

## shiftAdHocRounds

Move `roundNumber` to `targetRoundNumber`.

```js
tournamentEngine.shiftAdHocRounds({
  targetRoundNumber,
  roundNumber,
  structureId,
  drawId,
});
```

---

## swapAdHocRounds

Swap `roundNumbers`. Must provide an array of two valid `roundNumbers`.

```js
tournamentEngine.swapAdHocRounds({
  roundNumbers: [2, 4],
  structureId,
  drawId,
});
```

---

## swapDrawPositionAssignments

Swaps the `participantIds` of two `drawPositions`.

```js
engine.swapDrawPositionAssignments({
  drawPositions,
  structureId,
  drawId,
});
```

---

## updateTeamLineUp

See [validateLineUp](/docs/governors/participant-governor#validatelineup)

```js
engine.updateTeamLineUp({
  participantId, // id of the team for which lineUp is being updated
  tieFormat, // valid tieFormat - used to validate collectionIds
  lineUp, // valid lineUp array
  drawId, // required as latest lineUp modification is stored in an extension on drawDefinition
});
```

---

## withdrawParticipantAtDrawPosition

Thin wrapper around [removeDrawPositionAssignment](#removedrawpositionassignment). This method is included in `validActions` for [positionActions](../policies/positionActions).

```js
engine.withdrawParticipantAtDrawPosition({
  entryStatus = WITHDRAWN,
  replaceWithBye, // optional
  drawDefinition,
  drawPosition,
  structureId,
  destroyPair, // optional - decompose PAIR participant into UNPAIRED participants
});
```
