## CODES as Historical Preservation

After a tournament has been completed, a **[CODES](/docs/data-standards#codes)** document serves as a comprehensive "time capsule" containing all information related to the construction, management, and outcomes of a tournament. This single **cross-platform, database-independent JSON file** provides complete historical preservation without reliance on active software systems or database infrastructure.

### Complete Tournament Reconstruction

A CODES tournament record preserves:

**Tournament Configuration**:

- Dates, venues, surfaces, and tournament categories
- Applied policies for seeding, avoidance, and scheduling
- Event structures and formats (elimination, round robin, compass draws)
- Tie formats for team competitions

**Participant Information**:

- All registered participants with biographical data
- Scale items (rankings, ratings, seeding values) at time of tournament
- Entry information and seeding assignments
- Team compositions and representative organizations

**Draw Structure**:

- Complete draw generation history
- Seeding placements and avoidance policy application
- Position actions (swaps, withdrawals, substitutions)
- Bye placements and progression logic

**Competition History**:

- All matchUps with scheduling assignments
- Complete scoring including set-by-set and point-by-point details
- Outcome determinations (completed, walkover, retirement, default)
- Officials assignments and court assignments

**Temporal Evolution**:

- [Time Items](./concepts/timeItems) tracking changes over time
- Court and time assignment modifications
- Status transitions (scheduled, in progress, completed)
- Withdrawal and substitution history

**Metadata and Audit Trails**:

- [Extensions](./concepts/extensions) with configuration and calculated results
- Position actions for draw modifications
- Draw deletions and tie format modifications
- Factory version tracking for reproducibility

### Liberation from Legacy System Constraints

Traditional tournament management systems have created significant operational burdens and vendor dependencies that the time capsule approach eliminates:

#### Database-Centric Problems

**Relational Database Dependency**:

- Tournaments stored across dozens or hundreds of database tables
- Data scattered throughout normalized schema
- Relationships defined by foreign keys specific to database platform
- Complete tournament picture requires complex SQL joins

**Schema Evolution Over Time**:

- Each software version introduces schema changes
- Business logic must negotiate between different schema versions
- Historical data may require migration to current schema
- Breaking changes prevent access to old tournament data

**Stored Procedures and Platform Lock-In**:

- Business logic embedded in database-specific stored procedures
- Procedures written in proprietary languages (PL/SQL, T-SQL, PL/pgSQL)
- Database version upgrades can break existing procedures
- Cannot move data to different database platform without rewriting logic

**Third-Party Database Licenses**:

- Organizations pay ongoing fees for database software
- Database administrator expertise required
- Backup and disaster recovery tied to database platform
- Scaling requires expensive database infrastructure

**Complex Deployment Requirements**:

- Database server installation and configuration
- Network configuration and security
- Backup schedules and disaster recovery procedures
- Version compatibility between application and database

#### Time Capsule Advantages

The CODES time capsule approach provides:

**Single File Simplicity**:

- One JSON file contains complete tournament
- No database required for historical access
- Copy, email, or archive like any document
- Open in text editor for human inspection

**Zero Vendor Lock-In**:

- No maintenance contracts required to access data
- No software licenses needed to read historical records
- No dependency on vendor staying in business
- No concern about End-of-Life announcements

**Platform Independence**:

- Works on any operating system
- Readable by any programming language
- Store in filesystem, cloud storage, or database
- Use SQL, NoSQL, or no database at all

**Future-Proof Data Preservation**:

- JSON format will remain readable indefinitely
- Self-describing structure doesn't require external schema
- No concern about software version compatibility
- Standards-based format ensures long-term accessibility

**Simplified Operations**:

- No database installation or administration
- No backup scripts or disaster recovery plans specific to database
- No database licenses or subscription fees
- No database version upgrade cycles

### Active Tournament vs Time Capsule

CODES documents serve dual purposes throughout their lifecycle:

#### Active Tournament State

**During Tournament**:

- CODES as mutable working document
- Real-time updates to matchUp scores and scheduling
- Draw modifications and participant withdrawals
- Live state management through [state engines](/docs/engines/state-engines)

**State Management**:

- In-memory document manipulation
- Validation on every mutation
- [Subscriptions](/docs/engines/subscriptions) for real-time sync
- Concurrent access through proper state engines

**Operational Characteristics**:

- Performance optimized for live operations
- Change frequency can be very high during play
- Immediate consistency requirements
- API-driven mutations only

#### Historical Time Capsule

**After Tournament Completion**:

- CODES as immutable historical record
- Complete preservation of all tournament details
- Archival storage without database dependency
- Long-term retention without software maintenance

**Analytical Access**:

- Full tournament reconstruction from single file
- Statistical analysis without database queries
- Historical comparisons across tournaments
- Research and dispute resolution

**Storage Characteristics**:

- Compress for efficient long-term storage
- Archive to cloud storage (S3, GCS, Azure Blob)
- Version control for tournament record history
- No database required for access

### Hybrid Architectures

Production systems often combine CODES time capsules with SQL databases for different use cases:

#### When to Use CODES Documents Directly

- Active tournament management during events
- Complete tournament preservation for archives
- Offline operations without database access
- Export and sharing with external systems
- Regulatory compliance requiring complete records

#### When to Use SQL Databases

- Cross-tournament queries and aggregations
- Historical trend analysis spanning years
- Participant career statistics
- Ranking calculations across all tournaments
- Business intelligence and reporting

#### Real-Time Synchronization

Use [Subscriptions](/docs/engines/subscriptions) to:

- Keep SQL databases current during active tournaments
- Publish changes to analytical data stores
- Enable real-time dashboards and reports
- Maintain event-driven architecture

#### Bulk Pipeline Processing

Use data pipelines to:

- Re-process historical CODES archives
- Populate analytical databases from completed tournaments
- Migrate legacy data to CODES format
- Generate aggregate statistics and rankings

The time capsule approach gives organizations maximum flexibility: use CODES documents during tournaments, archive them for historical preservation, and optionally populate SQL databases for analytical queries - all while maintaining complete data independence and portability.
