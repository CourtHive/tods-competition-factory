/*
  seedBlocks for 32 seeds in a draw of 128 are as follows:

  [
    { drawPositions: [ 1 ], seedNumbers: [ 1 ] },
    { drawPositions: [ 128 ], seedNumbers: [ 2 ] },
    { drawPositions: [ 33, 96 ], seedNumbers: [ 3, 4 ] },
    { drawPositions: [ 17, 49, 80, 112 ], seedNumbers: [ 5, 6, 7, 8 ] },
    {
      drawPositions: [ 9, 25,  41,  57, 72, 88, 104, 120 ],
      seedNumbers: [ 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 ] },
    {
      drawPositions: [ 5,  13, 21, 29, 37, 45, 53, 61, 68, 76, 84, 92, 100, 108, 116, 124 ],
      seedNumbers: [ 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32 ]
    }
  ]

  When the number of BYEs to be distributed for a seedBlock is LESS than the number of seed position in the block
  it is necessary to evenly distribute the BYEs across all divisions, e.g. 1/2, 1/4, 1/8

  For instance, in a draw of 128 with 116 participants there are 12 BYEs.  The first 8 BYEs are consumed by the
  first four seedBlocks leaving 4 BYEs to b distributed  across the 8 drawPositions claimed by seeds 9-16.

  The drawPositions for seeds 9-16 are:
  [ 9, 25,  41,  57, 72, 88, 104, 120 ]

  These are sorted low to high and grouped in chunks of 2 drawPositions: 
  [9, 25],  [41,  57], [72, 88], [104, 120]

  These are then transformed into nested arrays which are each level an array of 2 items:
  [[9, 25],  [41, 57]], [[72, 88], [104, 120]]

  This nesting corresponds to the initial round of elimination structures which always contains power-of-2 drawPositions

  An even distribution of BYEs to seeded drawPositions is achieved by iteratively popping a drawPosition from the nested structure,
  at each level comparing the flattened length of the 2 items of the array

  For comparison, the nesting of seed 17-32 would be as follows:
  [[[5,  13], [21, 29]], [[37, 45], [53, 61]]], [[[68, 76], [84, 92]], [[100, 108], [116, 124]]],
