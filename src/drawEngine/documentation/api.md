## getParticipantIdFinishingPositions

Returns the range of finishing positions for all participants

- @param {string} drawId - drawId of target draw within a tournament
- @param {object[]} tournamentParticipants - optional - to return matchUps with inContext participant details
- @param {boolean} byeAdvancements - whether or not to consider byeAdancements in returns finishingPositionRange

---

## getPositionsPlayedOff

Determines which finishing positions will be returned by a draw. For example, a First Match Loser Consolation with a draw size of 16 will playoff possitions 1, 2, 9 and 10.

```js
const { positionsPlayedOff } = getPositionsPlayedOff({ drawDefinition });
```

---

## getRoundMatchUps

Organizes matchUps by roundNumber. **roundMatchUps** contains matchUp objects; **roundProfile** provides an overview of drawPositions which have advanced to each round, a matchUpsCount, finishingPositionRange for winners and losers, and finishingRound.

```js
const { roundMatchUps, roundProfile } = getRoundMatchUps({ matchUps });
```

---

## getSourceRounds

Returns the round numbers for desired playoff positions.

```js
const {
  sourceRounds, // all source rounds for playedOff positions and specified playoffPositions
  playoffSourceRounds,
  playedOffSourceRounds,
  playoffPositionsReturned,
} = getSourceRounds({
  drawDefinition,
  structureId,
  playoffPositions: [3, 4],
});
```

---

## getStructureSeedAssignments

Returns seedAssignments a specific structure based on structureId or structure

| Parameters     | Required | Type   | Description                                     |
| :------------- | :------- | :----- | :---------------------------------------------- |
| drawDefinition | required | object | drawDefinition object                           |
| structure      | Optional | object | Return seedAssignments for a specific structure |
| structureId    | Optional | string | Return seedAssignments for a specific structure |

The result is an array of objects which contain seeding details for all structures within the current draw

| Object Attributes | Type   | Description                                                   |
| :---------------- | :----- | :------------------------------------------------------------ |
| structureId       | string | unique identifier for draw structure                          |
| seedAssignments   | array  | array of assignment objects                                   |
| stage             | string | draw stage within which structure appears                     |
| stageSequence     | number | stageSequence within a draw stage                             |
| seedLimit         | number | either defined structure seedLimit or number of drawPositions |

The structure of an **_assignment object_** is as follows:

```json
{
  "seedNumber": 1,
  "seedValue": 1,
  "participantId": "uuid-of-participant"
}
```

The most basic usage is to retrieve seed assignments for a draw which has a single main stage structure

```js
drawEngine.setState(drawDefinition);
const structureId = drawDefinition.structures[0].structureId;
const structureSeedingDetails = drawEngine.getStructureSeedAssignments({
  structureId,
});
const firstStructureDetails = structureSeedingDetails[0];
const { seedAssignments } = firstStructureDetails;
```

## getSetComplement

---

## getState

No parameters.

Returns a deep copy of the current drawEngine state.

```js
const { drawDefinition } = drawEngine.getState();
```

---

## getRoundPresentationProfile

Returns an object describing draw rounds such that they can be generated as independent columns

- @param {boolean} isRoundRobin - flag to determine whether to generate for round robin or elimination structure
- @param {object[]} matchUps - inContext matchUp objects, generally provided by **getAllStructureMatchUps()**

---

## getStructureQualifiersCount

---

## getTiebreakComplement

---

## initializeStructureSeedAssignments

## isCompletedStructure

Expects drawEngine.setState(drawDefinition) has been previously called
Returns boolean whether all matchUps in a given structure have been completed

- @param {string} structureId

---

## matchUpActions

Return an array of all validActions for a given matchUp

- @param {object} drawDefinition
- @param {string} matchUpId - id of matchUp for which validActions will be returned

---

## matchUpDuration

---

## matchUpSort

Useful for automatically scoring all matchUps in connected draw structures

- @param {object} a - matchUp object
- @param {object} b - matchUp object

---

## setState

Loads a drawDefinition into drawEngine.

```js
drawEngine.setsState(drawDefinition, deepCopy);
```

By default a deep copy of the tournament record is made so that mutations made by drawEngine do not affect the source object. An optional boolean parameter, _deepCopy_ can be set to false to override this default behavior.

---

## setSubscriptions

Please refer to the [Subscriptions](/concepts/subscriptions) in General Concepts.

---

## structureSort

Sorting function to arrange structures by positionAssignments count (size) then stageSequence

- @param {object} b - matchUp object

## swapDrawPositionAssignments

- @param {string} drawId - id of drawDefinition within which structure is found
- @param {string} structureId - id of structure of drawPosition

---

## validDrawPositions

Returns boolean indicating whether all matchUps have valid draw positions
