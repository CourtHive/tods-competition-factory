# Subscriptions

Subscriptions enable external methods to be called when certain events occur while the Competition Factory engines are mutating a tournament document.

```js
const subscriptions = {
  audit: (payload) => {}, // payload = [{ action: '', payload: {} }]
  modifyMatchUp: (payload) => {}, // payload = { matchUp }
  addMatchUps: (payload) => {}, // payload = { matchUps }
  deletedMatchUpIds: (payload) => {}, // payload = { matchUpIds }
};
```

Subscriptions can be defined for the following engines.

```js
drawEngine.setSubscriptions(subscriptions);
tournamentEngine.setSubscriptions(subscriptions);
competitionEngine.setSubscriptions(subscriptions);
```
