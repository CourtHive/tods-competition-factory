/**
 * ITF World Tennis Tour Ranking System — Ranking Points Policy
 *
 * Source: itf-points-explained.pdf (2020 rules, current system)
 *
 * The ITF World Tennis Ranking is a parallel ranking system to ATP/WTA rankings.
 * From 2020, ITF points are ONLY awarded for qualifying rounds at $15,000 and
 * $25,000 tournaments. Main draw results earn ATP/WTA points instead.
 *
 * Tournament Tiers (mapped to factory levels):
 *   Level 1: $25,000 +H (with hospitality)
 *   Level 2: $25,000
 *   Level 3: $15,000 +H (with hospitality)
 *   Level 4: $15,000
 *
 * Points are identical for Men's and Women's singles/doubles.
 * Ranking lists are separate by gender.
 *
 * Aggregation: Best 14 results from rolling 52-week period.
 *
 * Doubles: Same points as singles from QF to Winner. No points for R16 loss.
 * In 2020 qualifying-only system, doubles qualifying points follow same rules.
