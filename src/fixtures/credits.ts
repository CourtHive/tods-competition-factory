    This project would not have been possible without the generous input and patience
    of tournament organizers and directors who worked with early versions of CourtHive/TMX.

    Thanks to Miro, Pavel, Ivan, Mladen, Zdenko, Antonia, Jakov, Kreso, Barry, Jeff, Bobby... to name just a few. 

    The project would not have even begun without the support of Miro, or the introduction by Sretchko.
    The project would not have succeeded without the enthusiasm of Randy and Bruce.
    Thanks to serendipity and Luca and the ensuing TODS conversations with ITF.
    Thanks to Scott and Jake for sanity checks, suggestions, and camaraderie.
    Thanks to Zoran for inspiring the async support and getting into the weeds with subscriptions.
    Thanks to Dave for backing the conversion of TMX 1.x source into the factory repository.
    Thanks to Vuk and Pavle and Rich and Chris and Deepa for the direct engagement with the APIs.
    Thanks to Joe for repeatedly challenging me and the many pointers to useful tooling.
    Thanks to Shannon for the validation of the approach from his deep domain experience.
    Thanks to Nikola for the ongoing camaraderie and explorations of what we can do with TODS.

    And a special thanks to my family for putting up with the long days and weeks and months of coding
    and conversations at all hours.
